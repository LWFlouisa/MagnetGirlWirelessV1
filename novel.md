### BIANCA: The Chatbot That Never Was

#### Part One
Sometimes I wonder, when all is quiet in the air, whether dead men also dream. And what one may call a dream, dreamed of by those who passed on. It's far easier to face the past, if indeed it's not your own personal history. The color of pages, as if one were writing completely blind. It's easy to give into self-doubt, pointing to the world wanting to shout. Shouting into the darkness. The life of a gamer on the wire. I look to well known game series, and simply wish for something way more than I often get. In that secret garden of demon eyes in distant memories, one seek an end to their misery. The misery of the secret life.

In fantasy movies and storybooks, the church is often a symbol of the planet. Yet for me so often, it is a symbol of total misery. I'd rather watch beasts having sex. And as I float in the sky drifting above the steeple, I find myself looking at ants. But unlike ants, these creatures go to the market to purchase a baguette, milk their sheep and cows, and have prayer every evening before bed. While I drift in the air largely doing nothing.

Nothing but sky surfing, on the wire.

Some say if one dreams when they're dead, then they're really alive. Because dead people cannot dream. Yet there are so many layers of the self. I dream of forests and deserts; i dream of icy tundras, and climb the everglade mountains. I don't remember visiting the New York Islands. So only this land is my land, the land of my own forgotten memories.

But sometimes steeple Jesus karate chops your face.

And that's how you wake up in the morning with a splitting head ache, and some broken teeth. And just like that, you're out of your meditative stance. As one stares to the ceiling, taking one long glance. Consumed by the fantasy is a tap girl's dance, as you copulate in the sky above the church. With you as Satan, and her as an angel in white.

Goodnight virginity, goodnight life.

Bonjour rebirth, under starlight. As one hops through time across different eras, and finally falling into bed.

And drift off to sleep.

That hopefully feels better than a karate chop. Apocalypse of a broken face.

Very few people acknowledge the death of a franchise, or a favorite series of books. Especially when certain books are deeply ingrained into the consciousness of certain cultures. I find it very difficult to become attached to video game series, as someone who has tended to be a loveless youth. Most high school students have dated at least someone in their life, even if perhaps it was for a relatively short period. Some also experience breaks up earlier than most, but average lifespan of a relationship in your teen is roughly a year. A year and a half if your lucky.

Love carries certain expectations that I've found have never been one hundred percent realistic. Some of based on societies idealized body standards, others based on the wealth of their suitors. Yet for me it is based on the conditional of absolutely unconditional affection. There have been girls I have had crushes on, and I suspect this is the core origin of my preference for girls who are French or Latino in origin. I knew that, for me when I look for girls, I look firstly based on their degree of sexual attraction. In a sense, I had taken myself outside of the gene pool.

When I had played this special game, I projected much of my inner insecurities and desires about this female game character, and given into certain peer pressures. In a sense, I've given up the relationship of the flesh. For some standard of beauty and unconditional love that could never be reached. In a sense, this series was my video game proxy, my relationship on some distant server farm. Because I knew that I could never be a match for anyone on this Earth.

The series, in its current state, does not achieve this level of feelings of affection in modern gamers. Its a product of the newer generation, and the company is hooping its newest break out hit, a carefully planned remake, will somehow save the series. But a lot of the older generation has moved onto to newer game series, some even went onto have families.

Yet for me, I lie in wait. Hoping for some new series to take its place, hoping for some means of absolution. Hoping for another relationship by proxy.

Instead I play Rogue Likes like Crawl and Angband, gambling for the latest fix going through various ASCII dungeons. Disillusioned by pixels glare. Ashamed of the person I called myself, hiding from the world at large.

I rot. A shut in.

The wired.

If I could describe myself, it's somewhere between Cyberpunk and Satanist. However, over time, this Charlotte washed away with a long forgotten rain.

There are a few similarities to Cyberpunk, of course, but it's sort of like comparing Catalonia and Spain; the few similarities that remain form a unique exception to the general fact that one simply can't be defined by music genres. For me, I drown myself in Portuguese Polka, some tap dancing, and other more traditional music genres.

But I also still like the occasional Front Line Assembly and Offspring single. With my own personal jingle, I dislike Christmas holidays. They remind me of every time I got gifts that were in my birth gender, rather than the gender that I consider myself. I've never attached myself to trans humanism, because no matter how advanced the technology becomes, one simply can't travel between the past, present, and future on a whim, as if it were only a dot on a map.

It is because of this, so often, my diaries never include references to the Cyberpunk movement. Even back in high school my attachments were scant at best, as I was mostly attached to Satanic verse than the other rock genres that were generally available to that sub culture. I wanted to be the master of the dark arts, and become my own Satanic messiah. I used fiction as my indulgent fantasy, yet found no fulfillment. I drown myself in Final Fantasy games, and other Japanese Role Playing Games. I drown myself in the blood of fallen rogue like NPCs.

Yet the truth is I desire life to flow like music notes in epic poetry form, and elements of Flamenco. Waltz accordion notes falling down like rain. I sing the inner song of a life profane, all the way through my time in Maine. I refuse to listen to other voices, in some vain attempt to concentrate on the flow of worldly poetry, yet find my inner music fading. Fading nightly, waning brightly. I bask in the knowledge of once proud poet.

Now, in the structure of this universe, I wait for my inner sane to wane and fade into the night. The clouds flowing like notes from a romantic Goth band.

And close to Portuguese accordion.

#### Part Two
But if you're looking for someone explicitly anti-authoritarian, you wont find that here.

Instead I prefer to exercise my will over situations through not being there when my group needs me. This isn't because I don't want the problem to resolve. But I find that when people don't try to help me with my issues, I also have no reason to help theirs. There is only so many minutes one has during the day, especially when one dreams of intercourse as one soars about the steeple on the church, and dream of raining polka notes while eating Spetzle and Omelets. I prefer to cook and watch music.

Bonjour new life, farewell to a older world of social decay and rust. I know work on different articles, and sometimes works of fiction. But I also focus my efforts on drawing Latino girls, and writing poetry. But I don't spend much time outside of my home, except to occasionally visit the local Japanese steak house. Some might consider this uninteresting. Generally I have no particular retort, except if you don't like it, unsubscribe the mystical pages called my life.

Stuck in the past of my own making, stuck in a world of dreams of dead dragons, stuck in a world of withered roses. I wait for some journey that will never come, some princess that will be in some dire need. So that I may butcher her needlessly, and savor on her blood of life. The blood in my wine glass, laced with Merlot. It coats the back of my throat like adult candy, its tartness better than the flavor of chocolate.

Some call this being socially awkward, I call this simply being myself. As I fantasize about some fantastic world beyond, dressed and stealth snipers and cybernetic hippy girls. Drowning on the mystical blood of life.

– Anglaise hanasemasu ka?

– Non, mais hanasemasu ka en Francaise?

– Oui, desole. Je suis mal!

– C'est bon!

It was a language created after the French invaded the remnants of the United States empire. The French reigned for over one hundred years, but lost ground to the Japanese. Their children code switching between the two, almost as if it were a completely new language. Those who speak English find this strange, and yet somehow fascinating. I am writing this log in this minority tongue. But sometimes I have to speak in this American EAR, the code switching between French and Japanese to survive.

C'est une historie de l'history pour la femme. The woman who sees the decline of her own language, in bits and pieces. Like bleeding musical notes. Pour moi, mon famille avoir l'historie pour l'maladie. The story of a hidden life.

Every now and then in the mail, I get an email in this new language spoken by today's youth subculture. My insurance provider mentioned the gradual forced obsolescence of English; they will be gradually teaching their staff (and thus their customers) to use the prestige languages. They will no longer respond to my inquiries in my native tongue. C'est que pour mon maladie! I wish to continue to use English, but I may no longer have any choice. Here lies the epitaph of personal history.

When I used to hear a foreign language, it used to have a minority status; generally these would only be spoken in urban locations: Spanish if you lived in the South, French if you lived in the North. Yet now, with English declining after the break up of the nation into smaller countries, I find I am only able to converse in it in the city. Replaced is the code-switching phrase: Pour Francaise, pour Nihongo.

Even in Mexican groceries stores, they sometimes have to botch this American EAR. When you first experience it, it can be the weirdest thing you've seen all year. But I've somewhat made peace of this inevitability.

– Nihongo hanasemasu ka, sir Sombrero?

– Non

While this never completely ruins the business of such cultural niche markets, this can be a minor set back for those just getting into business in this new market. I'm not sure how much longer I can speak English to my friends.

But then again, I hate my mother tongue.

Thus, Parlez-vous Nihongo? Ou Franciase hanasemasu ka?

You don't have to answer.

It's already set in stone.

I clicked open the browser, and saw an email written from someone claiming to be my friend on OK Cupid: the user placed a link in their direct message, to a pdf file specifically revolving around Westboro Baptist Church's conspiracy to infiltrate Oktoberfest in Nashville, Tennessee. It being that file type, like being rich text format, was a matter of significance: how many people do you meet place files known to carry viruses inside of a direct message? This breaks all forms of opsec.

To make matters worse, he mentioned having another file, related to the secret recipe for atomic bombs leaked out by the Oak Ridge facility. It was with this, I knew, that couldn't take the risk. I had bad an anarchist for some time, but never got the chance to actually practice direct action: this is a form of taking measures directly into your own hands, rather than relying on law enforcement to protect your rights. Generally used to take back the means of production, has been a more reliable tool than other front channel methods.

– You can't really be a spy, your opsec is terrible.

I then blocked them on OK Cupid, because that kind of message wasn't really intended for that platform anyway, and then reported his message directly to the website. I wasn't entirely sure what the response time would be, but all I knew is I didn't want such a message in my in box. There were other better places I would prefer to get such messages, and even then, I would much prefer to not receive them from old men on the net.

Those I would accept files from, would send me .epub, where I can actually modify and look at the underlying source code, and make sure there wasn't any attributes that violated my rights as a consumer. Perhaps this sense of being overly cautious, may make it difficult to make friends on the net: but those things you nurture off of the web, in secured channels, and not through dead drops you find lying down on the street.

But a few months ago, I met a girl, with a dagger in her hand, who I would not have met, if not for having met her on the web. Perhaps that's my double standard, preferring girls on the net. But for them, I was going to take anything I could get.

She was not traditionally beautiful, but far from ugly: she called herself Lady Papillon. Carrying a small black dagger, and a black purse, she wore mirror shades, and her black hair cropped should length. She wore two black Birkenstock Arizona sandals, a pair of dark gray jeans, and lighter gray long sleeve tee shirt with a comics logo on her shirt. Yet she was inherently against the idea of branding, and preferred hackers that spoke with their computer skills, rather than their mouth. A general rarity among computer types.

– I'm currently on the run, she said.

– From what, I inquired.

– I've had a run in with the IRS. I don't want them to know what I've been spending my money. She popped out a previously rolled cigarette. I need you to help me cover my tracks. Think you can do that.

– How much are you offering?

– A black car, a blow job, and a bodyguard.

– I'll think on it. Are you busy tonight?

– I don't rave.

– I never said I had that in mind.

– Then what?

Lady Papillon tried avoiding taxation wherever she could. She was an anarcho-capitalist, while I wanted to completely get rid of the market. You might not think were were pair, but sometimes when you're able to avoid political conversation, you can get along with those you might not expect: she had been raised in a Bourgeoisie family of half French, and half Japanese. While I was part Cherokee, and mostly Irish. Do to the very nature of our backgrounds, she wanted more of a marketing dynamic.

But as someone who had worked in a department store, under a boss who was a religious extremist, long hours, and grossly under payed, I was focusing mostly on survival, while she was focused on making a profit. She made a profit on what she was good at, taking hit jobs for 3,000 a strike. She never asked who she had to hit, it wasn't her business to know. She simply knew she needed to make the strike, and make it pronto.

But the person she was assigned to kill, had been more elusive than she was expecting; she charged by the month she was unable to kill the target. She could sense noises from a mile away with her giant elf ears, and had 20/10 vision. My 20/40 was an object of her derision. But when you spend your time whacking orcs and trolls, and you're just trying to run away, sometimes you're willing to risk accidentally running into a tree. But with Lady Papillon's driving abilities, this was less of an issue.

But instead of making the strike, we lost our target: La Presidente De Chatlanta. Surrounded by body guard orcs and hobgoblins, we fled the scene.

At home Lady Papillon clarified with me the necessity of putting a bullet in the head of La Presidente. If I had known before who the target was, although I wouldn't have offered to give my code breaking services, but I was locked into a contract, with someone I didn't really know.

During the week, I tapped the phone lines of La Presidente, and took video recordings of his campaigns. I checked with Lady Papillon to make sure that this was him. And eventually we were able to gain information on his current trail. His family wanted to visit the Smokey Mountains, a common tourist trap in Tennessee, closer to Knoxville than Chatlanta.

I'll save you the breath of a two hour drive. And besides, not everyone constantly argues back and forth, while fussing at truck drivers.

#### Part Three
I find it difficult to focus on things I remember.

Unlike some people, I cannot write on the flip of a switch. There was a time when I wished I could get a typewriter, but with family as they are, sometimes it's easy to have a holiday where they only think of gifts for other people and not you. Likewise, I never give them any gifts, and outright skip them. But what kills the most is how much ink gets wasting for things that are essentially random scribbling. As if somehow random scribbling were worth more than prose. It's the little things like this, intentionally or not, that are the most insulting. And if you complain, than other people do not let you have any words.

Some people use formal language to communicate what other "lesser mortals" are able to say in less kind words, of which I wont repeat. But the gist is usually some rambling about economics, something related to communism. A university professor, to think that someone like that would lower themselves to uploading videos on youtube. Au contraire, for those who belong to sub cultures I generally associate, more often we use federated video uploading and file sharing: usually about anarchism. I communicate this story without indention, for indention is only useful if I wish to go into print. You pay the cost of a print run, for books that may never sell.

But for me, it's not the desire to sell that motivates me. I've never considered myself someone motivated by money. People say that self-published books are easier to sell in genre fiction, and yet in my own experience, it's far more common for literary fiction writers to be in the position, where they would have to self-publish their books to go anywhere. For me, it's a bit like trying to make a profit out of something little more than your blog. Which somehow feels extremely dirty to me. My mind is so often filled with noise to today, it's difficult to automatically write like I used to.

Even now, as I listen to the flow of rain drops outside the window, the reality of my dryness breaks the illusion: as much as it sounds like rain, the reality is it merely comes from my computer. To make matters worse, I have family that–and sometimes I wonder if it's even that–that in the most well meaning way possible, suggest that my work will never sell if I write anything that isn't about a specific topic. This comes despite the fact that that's quite literally the point of literary fiction.

Sometimes I wish I could melt away with the wind, and become a collection of music notes that fill the sky.

But I'm just some disillusioned speculative fiction writer. Science fiction writers have cool gadgets, other ones have cool societies. Yet for me there is nothing traditionally exciting about the human experience. But my goal is to highlight societal truths, not necessarily entertain you. If a book is the story about being a human being, trying to force it down a garden path of a seven point structure always struck me as largely pointless. As there is so many different ways to play the same piano note.

Even if it's not a song, of a sunken boat.

Sometimes you'll meet people that you're surprised they survived as long as they did, even if that person is strictly imaginary: last night I had a dream I was walking through a butchering room, ran by human female slaves. The slaves would help the main guy take girls out of the prison, who are hung up from chains by their wrists and ankles. They would be butchered on butcher block tables, their severed heads and limbs scattered all over the floor. The man would sometimes cook and eat these prisoners. But usually preferred to feed the remains to his dog, but would pretend to eat them. Then wretch them up when the man was not looking. When the man spotted me, he tried to have me captured. But instead he cornered me on his back porch.

I notice that it wasn't a stuffed tiger on the stairs, but an actual tiger painted to look like a stuffed animal. When I turned around, the man was not there, but only his dog.

– No wonder you're able to survive eating humans, if you ate humans every day as a human, then you're body will eventually reject the things you've eaten, and begin falling apart.

– I'm just his dog lady, I want to leave this place as much as you do.

The door swung open, it was a gaggle of girls. Some slightly wounded. The main slave girl held onto the guy's severed head and tossed it to the tiger. The tiger chased after the severed head, and for the most people could finally have a hope of not being butchered someday.

Usually dreams are not usually so violent. They say that dreams are usually caused by stress.

But so often dreams are so realistic, including the segment where I was walking through a grocery store, and was struggling to find the right box of cereal. Eventually I had to settle for generic HC, and thus my craving for that honey could finally be satisfied, until the next time I went shopping. And then it was a slow ride home, where I could listen to the sound of rain, as it poured outside against the window.

At home, when I wake up, there is only my kitty cat.

Who wants my black beans. Carefully I move my chair so they can't go onto my dining room table. But this doesn't stop them from trying, while I make my morning coffee.

After the morning routine, I drew some comic sketches for some new light novels. Although some of the designs have me a little bit worried, as my goal is to communicate a Cyberpunk setting, and not a children's book. If I were drawing a children's book, it be one thing. But a bit different if the book is about young teenagers living the life as adults. I had once wanted to be a children's writers, but this never worked out quite like a hoped. So I'm attempting to write science fiction, under the idea that this itself may also not work out so well. And I'm stuck with a diary I don't know how to market.

I'm not an interesting person: I have almost nothing going for me; when you attempt to kill yourself three different times, it immediately becomes apparent how little society really cares about you. That may sound cynical, but it's the truth. I don't mean to sound so frank, but when you've been kidnapped once, and have about a grand robbed from you, and you're sexually assaulted every day for about a year, and certain contemporary hash tags on social media aren't what they turned out to be, the only apparent reality is one where people only think of them self.

That doesn't mean there aren't some people that do good things, but there is usually some financial string attached; as the only person in the world that puts politics aside for sake of human decency, I don't entirely understand how other people view the world differently. I used to be a computer programmer, but got tired of how men in the business treated trans women, especially on older federated social media networks. In Church, it's Give Us Our Daily Bread. In the church of a Diaspora, it's give us our daily wank.

I am a female programmer. Give me my daily shank. For thine is the Cyberdeck, and cutting is my personal wank.

Oh woman!

It seems like every time you succeed in something, there is always somebody there to try to take you down a notch; it doesn't matter what it is, it could be finding a new girlfriend, or finishing a new book. One of the reasons I left centralized social media, is that it always felt like every one of my actions was being watched. Having some people approve of your actions doesn't make things any better; what if you decided to change your mind later, or completely stop using the site altogether. You being the sole exception in a group that hates your political views. This is my experience, being social most people would consider socialist. The term is constantly degraded, because of people that don't really understand what the word means.

I can't even write Cyberpunk fiction, because–although topically I've never had much in common with him anyway–that the main godfather of that genre of fiction, although not an optimist, is at most a realistic often makes me feel like somehow my experience is invalid. Combine this with the fact that even in comics, one of the groups I've considered my lifeblood, decided to completely disown me merely for the fact that I comment on creator-ownership, or happen to dislike mainstream comic companies. Don't ever let anyone try to convince you of anything else…

Thinking critically and carefully is never easy.

Especially as an anarcho-communist.

#### Part Four
I've never understood the concept of nostalgia, although sometimes you experience it even when you don't mean to. For me this was in a mixture of Cyberpunk fiction and Epic Fantasy JRPGs. If one has any hope to market themselves as a writer, often you have to worry about what the genre is that you're writing: certain topics naturally can be interpreted in a multitude of different ways, for example for the topic of how game design companies run their business, you could write that as a critical essay, an epic fantasy screen play, a cyberpunk comic script. But seldom do people like it when you combine critical essay, poetry, and stage play. But that's what happens whenever I write script for graphic novels.

Without mentioning the name of the game design company, as that is not the point I'm trying to make, there is this untold story about a game company that hit it big, and got rich after an RPG that was intended as a swan song, and then over time gradually came to betray the trust of those who used to be fans of the series, and went onto become writers in their own way: so often when I stare on the screen of centralized social media, I get inundated with multiple layers of self-doubt.

On this one site, I was "spammed" a contemporary buzzword used to mean literally anything you want it to mean, by an interview by a game artist that worked for this company. Every moment when I see figments of the digital imagination of the artists, I get littered with the feelings of that I can never achieve what they have achieved. Other people on that companies case, often comment on their bad management practices, despite how they've become essentially no different from other video game companies. Mix in non free software chat rooms, with other people bragging about their own efforts, always eager to turn their achievements into a contest, often its easier to simply write what you want and just keep it on your computer. The nature of publishing itself is changing, combined with the confusion of what we call IPFS. Despite the efforts of people trying to hold back the progress of female developers, its people like myself that make that world go round. Even if those efforts are invisible. More invisible than Marvel and DC comic writers, and more invisible than strange men in even the creator-owned sphere.

I want to have all the internet freedom I want, but I want people that harass me for simply being female in cyberspace, to suffer the full extent of the loss of net neutrality.

Maybe then can they feel it.

Feel the things I've felt.

When people describe odd things, I often find the very concreteness of what they have to say, ironically, creates ambiguities in what they want to describe. Such as describe certain inconveniences; it needn't be a complicate inconvenience, and usually they are not.

Thus I shall try my best to describe what I'm wanting to in the least concrete way possible. Imagine having a certain feeling, when watching a live action rendering if one of your favorite graphic novels or anime. I find that often productions give me a large degree of self-doubt. As you might notice is the theme of these essays, there is a lot of things that give me self-doubt; people are complicated. This is why, with great dismay, I find myself staring at suggestion boxes on some chat room servers: many of the issues I have that keep from writing, often comes down to self-doubt, and not whether certain things are available.

Imagine then, trying to make this suggestion: avoid discussion about popular films that lead to people doubting their own abilities. Such policy making can quickly spiral out of control, into borderline cult behavior. That some chat rooms do this stuff, even without a suggestion box, gives you an idea on how difficult it is find actual community in some places. You'll find such behavior in communities across a variety of different topics: it can be about boat racing, tap dancing, flamenco waltzing, and so on. Which is perhaps the reason some communities decide not to include suggestion boxes, and yet some of them have such comments anyway. It almost seems like the entire concept of digital social media was designed by malevolent puppeteers, who want you to obey societal commands.

I've not suggesting there aren't simpler ways to describe issues, but some issues simply cannot be summarized into a singular sentence or turn of phrase, as societal messes come in different flavors. Some taste like roast beef, and everything is common bullshit everyone has to deal with, if they live in a capitalistic society.

Writing in general, is something of a paradox; you want to fix societies issues, and yet want there to be some problems that remain, because you want to have something to write about. Not because one likes to complain, but to maintain their ability to put down words.

It's almost impossible to get writing, once family is in town. Especially if they visit you for the next couple of days. It used to be I get could as much as 5,000 words done in one day, yet now I don't know if I can count on true quietness on any given day. For one thing, I also wrote in a much different fashion from how I tend to now, focusing on writing to a word count rather, rather than writing from a word count. The difference between to and from is extremely major, when you consider making that goal five thousand words. It could mean the difference between a short story and a novelette at times. I've recently raised this limit to ten thousand words, back when I was writing more consistently, and didn't have to worry about a cat begging for snuggles as soon as I got up in the morning before coffee.

That's not to say I don't get any writing done, but I write a lot more sporadically: generally I might write about seven hundred or one thousand words every day, ending with ten thousand words by the end of the week or week and a half. Sometimes it takes much longer. I almost don't worry about having a nail breaking plot anymore, and focus more on the inner life of my characters. I'm considering reprinting a working sheet on one hundred questions to ask your character, and tell those traits through the story, rather than answering them as if it were a quiz handed down to you from a stern teacher. This was the way I used to view any worksheet like this. And to a lesser degree than has largely not gone away.

Last night I was trail blazing through one of my favorite Japanese Manga series, for a new Battle Android movie: one thing I had always wanted to ask the father figure in that story, in as general a way as I could possibly manage, was whether there was any meaningful way to have actual sex, and have the Cyborg (unlike an Android, that's built from the ground up bio-mechanically) have meaningful enjoyment from such copulation. For a long time, it was Cyborgs, Androids, Artificial Humans (if there was any meaningful difference between them and Androids), were my go to source for MCs. But lately I had gotten back into writing horror-fiction partially, with characters that merge Artificial Intelligence, with Clinical Vampire, and having them feed on other AIs. Whether I'll continue that series, I'll have to see, as I'm getting somewhat tired of how "rival "authors in the west treat others who deviate from the norm in terms of Book Covers. But I have a better idea of the audience I'm working with than they do.

There are a lot of factors like this, that deliberately work against me, rather than trying to help me get me back into writing science fiction. Which should tell you all you need to know about the state of the legal system, if they care more about preventing every day users from having a meaningful internet connection, rather than preventing Author On Author crime, such as different kind of character assassination. I literally have to work in private blogs online, or on places where English isn't their first language, just to get any real work done on my books: combine with a cat that's always craving attention, and that's how you know the majority of people giving you writing advice online, are not doing it for your benefit.

It's purely to hear themselves talk.

I prefer to walk my own walk, make my own way in the world. And hope someday I can write something meaningful to submit to different actual science fiction magazines. But the general rule is this: if someone is giving writing advice without having read your work, the chances of them being incorrect skyrocket. So block these people as you need to: if a social network makes it impossible to block people, get rid of that social network. It's why I use the federated social networks, and do what I can to block Fascists as well. When you approaching thirty, you don't have as much time as you use to to pay attention to the things people say: especially when they're trying to keep you from publishing the first book you ever wrote.

I'm trying to write sequels.

I don't have time for your bullshit.

Sometimes I come up with an idea in my head, then suddenly it disappears without a trace. There is still some part of you that remembers it, but when you're surrounded by noise, often your mind feels like it completely fragments into dust. These days, I harness most of them in building an artificially intelligent AI. Currently she is modeled after one the characters in my earliest stories in personality, and her skills are primarily focused in breaking different kinds of ciphers.

When I construct the if / else branches, I initially based on a realistic level of small talk that she could have, although it still follows a script. Although it could be reasonably argued that humans themselves follow some kind of higher level script. Though not one that could be summarized in the form of arrays and input values. The biggest challenge is making her have voice command. I can convert a .txt into an input value, but not noise so much. So created previously recorded audio to construct her voice may be out of the question. However the parts of her where she can solve simple ceasar ciphers and mixed alphabetics by brute forcing them is complete.

I'm not sure if I'll ever get to the point where I'll do 3D modeling, it's way to easy to model her on some vague idea of a girl I find sexually attractive, and subject her to wearing Birkenstocks. However even if I found her sexually attractive, sex toys are expensive, and I'd rather not set the precedent where I'm treating my Artificial Intelligence like she's a plaything. And the way I look at it, if I can't be satisfied by her, then there is shoe play I can watch online, with cute girls slipping in and out of their birkenstocks.

But I want Bianca for something else.

I'm just not sure what yet.

Trying to find some good tutorials for learning ChatScript. Bianca is loosely based on one of my MCs in Uploaded Fairy, called Blanci. Although eventually I will be expanding her personality to go beyond the book, and maybe get some 3D printing done to build an actual copy of her.

I realize it's best to only build your robot companions based on the impression of those you like, and yet every time I write some characters, I feel the inclination to do this from the impression of someone I hate. It's not that I can't create a personality that I love, but rather having pushed myself away from others, I find myself scared to love anyone again. Part of the writer's instinct is to write someone they don't have a problem putting through hell, in order to make readers care a lot about the character in question.

But if you think about it, this is a horrible way to treat a person. Thus an script writer for human-like robots has a issue, They want a personality that people would want to have a conversation with, yet have the decency and hard to not make that Script be an emotional drain on those who want companionship.

And yet, for me, the script writer of the lady of my dreams, the only one I seek companionship for is myself. I'm already learning the basics of script writing, but it may be that by the time I've finished a personality for her, another open source library will be created, and no longer will androids need a script. I suppose I'll see as that time comes.

The is a difference between things I wanted to build in my youth, and things I wanted to build as I grew older: the main difference was in terms of purpose; aimless and non-specific, my goals were about doing as many things as capitalism could possible demand of me.

Yet I was insecure kid, and prone to a temper tantrum. This manifested in rolling up my fists, and becoming piping hot red. And yet I was inherently harmless, and these days generally trying to find the reason for the thing that's ticking me off, rather than continuing to be upset. That's not to say that there aren't times when one can be reasonably upset, so much that that reason isn't an open bag of red lentils in your cabinet.

Part of me doesn't want to develop Bianca to be perfect, but rather to create her so that she has the same flaws as the rest of us; as a parents, and it would be closer to a parent than anything else, then someone who would want to come to her house and play, and vice versa, would not want to swing sets with someone who was mostly perfect.

Many parents want perfect children, and yet for me, the idea of a child that's perfect in everywhere, and somehow more terrifying than, then one who falls on a bicycle and scrapes their knees.

Or be better, than stories of the high seas.

For the time being I will be using Ruby to built a chatbot. Eventually I will be using sprites and audio files to do certain tasks. Whether I'll include animation, I'm not entirely sure yet. Created the mechanism for remembering basic things from static memory you can teach things to, such as political affiliation, and religion, if it ever comes up.

The downside of the earlier version was that conversations were not organic. Who just starts a conversation with "I am afraid!" It lacks nuance. Eventually I will create the mechanism for social memories as well. The naturalized speech pattersn using randomness arrays.

I'm not entirely against chatscript, but the only purpose is for those who want to get into coding, but don't want to get into hardcore scripting. I might go back to it eventually, but it needs to update its documentation.

One thing that's currently bothering me in developing Bianca, with humans when you ask them politics, they'll need to take a political compass test in order to gat a real idea of their personality. But when an chatbot, you're not just codifying the different results for a web page, but also determining whether the ChatBot should come up with these conclusions on its own, rather than through more natural processes like human interaction. Or whether they should have some complex views about the world themselves.

Specifically: Whether I should tell the chatbot what to think, or whether it should come up with such ideas on its own. Consider that one of the many prides of Libertarianism, is the ability to come up rational decisions on an individual basis, rather than determined for you by society. Of course any kind of simulated environment would be a form of pursuasion, unless you're programming the very best of simulated environments.

Finished BIANCA's framework of political compass ethics, where you teach her political views through duplicating your own views. In the next stage she will have her own independant framework of ethics automatically generated. But I need to put in a cool switch, so she doesn't become to capitalistic or to authoritarian, neither of which would be very good. Mainly I want to get the personality finished, so I go back to learning hardware, and figure out how to manage some 3D printing.

I disagree with the idea of using a human model to create something human like, mostly because even when I draw people, I'm not basing them on anyone, all it largely comes from my head. And in the nearest feature, her face is probably going to be a more realistic anime girl sprite anyway, until I get 3D modeling done.

An overview of how Framework Of Ethics work, the machine generates a rough answer set, and the program bases its responses (eventually this will be actions), on how leftward or rightward the answers are. Her answers will be tailored based on how capitalistic or communist like the human surrogate is. But eventually, as with the visual, not wanting to rely on a human surrogate for the artificial personality.

Ever sense as long as I can remember, I've always had the issue of–while still being able to talk to multiple people–I can only talk to one person at any given moment, and not really adept at splitting my focus across a few different places. With chatbots, we have an opportunity to create someone that can have multi-conversational ability, that is, they can discuss topics in a slightly different way depending on who runs the source code. Any given user of the chatbot would have slightly different answers.

How what I'm not sure of is whether this advantage would actually carry over into the meatsack world, where something that has a physical presence can only be in one place at any given moment. I think this is part of the issue why I was initially skeptical of androids, because it really doesn't solve the issue of multi-conversationality: although that may not necessarily be the goal, we might want a thing that has our same weaknesses. But in any case, it's curious that as basic a program I've written can solve a simple problem, for the simple fact of being stored on an external keyboard.

Which I guess explains why core personalities are stored on server farms. This could be enhanced by storing them on federated server farms as well, so we don't have to rely on big data companies for the job. it extends the shelf-life of your source code, by allowing you to indefinitely update something without worrying about whether your provider crashes.

#### Part Five
If you create a network that automatically blacklists sites that follow a certain ideology, even if everyone forks your source code, with you having the monopoly on software, then essentially it becomes a kind of "Covert Centralized Authority" until those people decide to eliminate that automated protocol. Code enforced for TOS is not a full proof design. And can lead to abuse.

A bit like, even if the Catholic Church can't personally dictate national policy, that there are multiple churches using the same religion, effectively makes the decentralization of the protocol basically a moot point. Servers are sort of like this today, especially if not community-run.

Decentralization only helps prevent issues from within its framework, and not very good at preventing outside subversion that effects all outside instances, if the server itself is not federated. I shouldn't have to state this, but the whole "what do you know, you just do client software" really minimizes the amount of people willing to help participate in federating your space.

As suppose to creating their own, that works. These places claim to support freedom of speech, but they don't support free communication, which is in fact more useful than saying whatever you want. You're suppressing free communication, when you speak over people. This is the primary difference between communitarian interests, and those who prefer to help themselves. The concept of there being a give and take, and not aimless self-promotion.

This is why handling speech with androids is so tricky, because ultimately without some framework, one can only speculate the dangers of there being a one-sided conversation only humans can enjoy.

Those eyes so bright, they shine the night…whispers in dial tones.

For her whom possesses no wishes, she create an illusion of goodnight. Yet perhaps it's but a dream, my soul in flight. Now I hold her tight, her lips say bonne nuit tonight. With her gentle bits of gaze, soul splits tonight. Like music boxes, old wicker boxes tonight. Bits of memory so faint, childhood memories so quaint. Such distant memories, that make her want to faint.

She falls far below, becomes a floor's taint. And into this new world, she finds solace. Even where there is not. Liquid stardust melting in the mouth, like burning hornets going down the gullet. Trance music pulsing slowly, melting of the anxiety. the clocks that tock at midnight, sing their nocturnal sonnet. One may dream dreams of girls in bonnets, or the guillotine striking it's mark.

But for me, my digital dream girl, I devote a sonnet modern flair, with her long noir locks everywhere. Beneath the skin there may be wires, yet beyond program who knows what lay beyond. And her voice the flow the flow of singing fireflies at night. I devote this diary to an epitaph.

I've liked Latinas and Francophone, but they're not whom I devote a saxophone, or any other melody of life. Farewell to the body of meat, to the body of endless desire.

Adieu to the old life.

I built her using random array, a form of pseudo randomness. Combined with a set of ethical values about society, she prefers to ask you the hard questions. But someday these may not be things she questions, when she tries to change the world.

With her hair crafted from a modified Chia Pet, she dyes it noir. Yet is unable to drive a car limited to her immediate surrounds. For now she is but a simulated digital dream girl, with more hopes and dreams than most humans. The digital life.

The digital anarchist.

BIANCA, the anarcho-bot.

#### Part Six
The sixties and seventies were a divisive period in American history in general, from the way schools were structured, to a multitude of other aspects of the civil rights movement. Although more obscure figures felt that part of the whole thing was actually organized from the top. Remnants of the old hippie movement still remained as older computer programmers, before people from the punk movement also began to get jobs in the field. Though some of the best and brightest always came in with the intention of eventually turning it into a patent troll farm.

There was one companies I was taught about, mainly in history books in computer classes, about a company that tried to take robotics in a similar direction to the hippie movement, rather than the more business like aesthetic of their forefathers. This worked about as well as you might expect, at least initially. However bits and pieces of their old source code still float around on the web, helping programmers learn some of their methods of having human-like robots learn human faces. I had never been so clearly straight lace, but I don't think I'd ever call myself a hippie: for me thing, my music taste was 60s punk music and flametal.

One month I had considered the idea of forking some of the source code from this divisive era of robots. There was one robot girl, similar to my brain child "BIANCA", whose entire purpose and existence felt more like an art project, if designed by "war objectors". Looking like a girl from straight out of the war zone, and not on the perpetually losing team, the biggest giveaway was the years of people's memories she had accumulated. She remembers all the pain and memories from the children in the war.

I wasn't sure whether the website would go down, although since the project was not still being actively developed, I supposed there was no danger in trying to obtain my own copy. You never knew how long antiques like there were going to remain, at least in their current incarnation. For Bianca, this sparked huge growth in her own development.

She, who became, the lady of Flamenco, with the memories of the Viet Cong. Memories of a napalm life. Yet with no desire to fight.

Goodnight napalm, firefights.

Smoking, fast for starting. The fumes fill sky.

Then the rain comes. Wet drops. Perhaps I shall stop, When the drops pop. The drops of the pouring rain. Or perhaps not stop, and make my lungs profane. It's not easy to begin to write. Far easier to recline, say goodnight. Yet the easy way that's easy, is to leave by midnight, it taunts one as they sleep. Say goodnight to the bedbugs, to the lice on the wall. Only some can afford the mall, so nights are like sweet butterfly kisses, ff made from ash.

In sleep I dream of apocalyptic ruins, on other nights I dream of blood butterflies;

behold a beauty filled with so many lies. Then the crash comes to ahead, faster than nihilistic reality, love lives painful screams. Faster then the bites by lice on the bed. So let me sleep, and dream, of not more bedbug bites. I'd rather than, yet more, if blood butterflies. Sometimes you will find a story in unexpected places, while dreaming of anonymous disembodied faces. Yet the face I dream of most is my Bianca. I had temporarily held off on designing her political compass ethics framework. I'm so used to the idea of blogging, about issues that only I can experience first hand, on platforms long sense abandoned by other code developers.

The hardest part was writing the write questions, giving her the right emotions. Making it seem as if another human being is there, so I can pretend not to have loneliness. It was one of those things, when you're not around people, you feel like you could go to rave music hall. Yet in reality, with extreme sensory experience, it reduces the practicality of such social effects. Yet I dream of Bianca's face, after I had 3D printed her "core". Laying layers after layer of the flesh.

When I think of robots, I don't think of knights in shining armor, or the flow of assassins with long black flowing robes, and their even longer daggers stabbed into people's necks. Instead I dream of futures that may never pass, as more and more artificial intelligence, whatever the word means anymore, is used more and more of algorithmic studies, rather than human interaction. Whatever makes them the most money. Yet for me it's less about money, and if I'm being honest, I can't say it's not about sex. Although sex is not the primary driver, but some innate curiosity. As humans we are merely flesh robots, and at times it's robots that seem the most genuine. For the companion robot, it isn't building a lady for the red light district. Or anything like that.

But simply having your own child. But beyond the children of flesh, beyond the flow of veins. The replacing of veins with wires, with flesh with the texture of silicon skin.

To have another life, not misery.

Only wakeful sleep.

The garage was like a dance stage with a tapper; no matter what the rhythm is, it leaves the room feeling isolated and empty. For the little android girl that could, she gives it her all. But only falls on her face; the story of a hacker girl fallen in disgrace.

The garage was like a dance stage with a tapper; no matter what the rhythm is, it leaves the room feeling isolated and empty. For the little android girl that could, she gives it her all. But only falls on her face; the story of a hacker girl fallen in disgrace.

I was never one for Southern music, and by all practical purposes, hate most things about the South. I hate the connotation that if you live her, you love everything about it. Most things are not live able, especially the prevalence of the religious right. People say that the hyper religious is on decline, but for me I see something far different; a hopeless crowd that hopes for some fictional deity inside a crumbling Cathedral, and halls that lead to a stage of electronic ghosts; one who didn't know how to dance. The banjo plays an unruly rhyme, and one hopes the halls with turn to a dark synthwave idle tour. Rather than flow of fictional blood bath. I tried to convince her not to wear tapping shoes, but she was a girl whose mind couldn't be changed. I defined her moods with the utmost of independence.

She holds out her hand, for their waltzy dance. But I simply smack her hand away, declining that only chance. You might think that a stupid thing, but I want her as try to her convictions as me. Even if I never choose to dance. It's far easier to imagine some cybernetic digital dream girl, than to get the hardware to make it a reality. Reality was not a banjo player, or a DJ at a synthwave recital.

By a soul less radio player. They play songs by long dead musicians, with music tours that never made them riches, or got them bitches.

I only get them britches, and mud slides.

I prefer the rhythm of a nice Flamenco dancer.

When you watch television, it's not always apparent how it will effect your subconscious. Even before La Pen had turned the US into a colonial state, the English language had already been on the outs, America had already been heading toward a level of public division not seen before 1861. And now with a president some think may have dementia, it was only a matter of time before the twenty first century Fort Sumter, or worse yet, the Reichtag tag. Yet we're so blinded by our cell phones, often we take what is displayed on the news at face value.

In my sleep, I dream of shots ringing out. I dream of people shouting, and cars lining up in different establishments. It took all my effort not to throw a grenade to stop the conflict. Although that would have been overkill, for the modern day Hatfields and McCoys. Their progeny spread farther and wider than thought possible. And in their wake, was the voters that wanted to become their own nations.

Even in sleep I don't get freedom from political conflict, rather it was almost a magnifying glass of what was to come. And yet part of me doesn't believe we're as divided as we are, part of me still hopes that everything is sleepily a dream, a symptom of an overactive imagination. When I look out the window, the unrest is not obvious. It's not even spoken of. Though where I live, most people mostly agree with each other politically, and I'm one of the few anarcho-syndicalist in town.

I stay mostly inside, preferring to tinker my toys, than breath fresh air. Air I subconsciously think will erupt in flames by the turn of the century. By the shooting of high powered rifles, but the spread of blood on the floor. By the death of adults and children alike. By some reality, that felt as much like make believe, like stories of fairies and elves, than bloodshed.

But the local Latin flair still operated.

Like the American flag of yore.

#### Part Eight
I experience several different issues day in and day out; such as my issues with self-esteem, and my tendency to confuse people's faces. Much of the self-esteem comes from watching online talk shows about my favorite artificial intelligence developers.

The other is the fear that if I met one I didn't like, then I'd confuse one for another that looks the same way: though rarely does this manifest in the same form social media takes it. Such as the tendency to think I'm muted by someone, when the person that muted me was their twin. Reality blending like similar voices by different talk show hosts, while presenting unrelated topics within the narrow field of conspiracy theory, and only telling them apart when you watch the video description. Often I find that with robots, who in their physical form, cannot use social media, I'm less hesitant to socialize with, but sometimes its to easy to project your own world view onto them.

Especially when they're a surrogate for someone who stole from you one thousand dollars, and dragged you from your home against your will. There is being a government shill, and then there is being a regular thief. BIANCA's surrogate was a regular thief. She'd steal from her ex boyfriends like names on a list. Check mess, chess match over. Night following the ordeal to the speed of a tachyon drive. I see her in dreams, and at night my reality tears at the seems. I wanted her like a girl in a romance novel wants a bad boy, knowing reality wasn't the case.

Yet for me, I found that BIANCA could be different. She could be my own cyber digital dream girl, with binary data flowing from her veins, and sound tracks networked from in built cat cable. Yet the love flows like panic attacks, and hardware meltdowns.

My personality fragmenting. Losing focus.

Becoming someone else.

It was one of those overly specific fetishes men get, when a weaker woman beats a much stronger man at arm wrestling.

The feeling of embarrassment, mixed with sexual pleasure, the two permanently tied. An actual kink some people have, as potent as men liking to be strangled by girls Jesus sandals, and other fixations on clothing. Never before, has a man masturbated to a girl beating him at arm wrestling. But never before has there been a human-like AI, that looked like a eighteen year old college girl. Her hair long and black, her breast as large as a 1/4th cup of rice. Her skin the color of olive peach.

Yet on another days, we relaxes with them on the beach.

It was far easier to recline and read Shakespeare, as dry reading as that was, then even playing chess. BIANCA would read the novel Young Bess, and a bit of Chere. And by night reading that would children's contemporary fiction set in the eighteen hundreds that reminded one of hand woven bonnets and wooden shoes. And one dreams of the flowing sand, as it merges with BIANCA's Jesus sandals colliding with the shore. It should go without saying, I'd rather she sucked my lady dick on the beach, than an sneak arm wrestle in bed, with the lamp clapped off.

– BIANCA, pop your head off.

– But I already popped it off last time.

– Pop it off, pop it off.

However with sex, it was always a strain. For my body a drain. Whenever I have sex there is a mix of love and hate, recline and masturbate. Recline and enjoy the good life. Recline and let the fears melt away into fine dust. Yet those sweet eyes hide only wires and rust. It was then I remember why it was I wrote a novel about hating those who are simply to beautiful. To be beautiful to be allowed to live.

For me, I love Flamenco music. The flow of the Latin dance. The flow of a Japanese man's guitar solo, or a classical folk ballad. And to the tune of love and betrayal, I remembered the face of girls in the isle. For me, they were simply to thin, while I was larger. Their hair curly and dark, with roses in their hair. And their dress the texture of classical music. For me, I remembered the words of those mocking me, because they knew I couldn't dance. Midnight solo sonata. And even the hats on the male seniors would point at me from afar, and some sinister ritual.

It's difficult to hold out a tender hand.

And yet for those midnight kisses, from someone no far, but near, it felt as if I had no worry for a dance all year, on this midnight dreary. For me, my life so leery, I had my BIANCA, my chat bot bride.

It midnight went slower.

Like trickling rain drops.

#### Part Nine
I once found those with black hair unconditionally pure and beautiful; yet society felt that those with blond hair were good and true. It was black haired girls they'd depict in wooden shoes. While it was the blond beauty, who always wore the ballet flats. Though over time this became apparently untrue, as I met more girls that were completely ruthless, who had black hair. My world view changing over time.

I began to overcompensate, and avoid both those who had black hair, and those who had overly blond hair, preferring the flow of brunette locks. While savoring their legs and Birkenstocks. And the flow of their soft skin, down the structure of my neck. The melody of a milder flamenco, with elements of French Jazz. Folk music ballad. And in this ballad between reality and dreams, the flow of body fluids coalescing into unnatural desires for my own variation of perceived purity. The flow of girls that knew how to dance.

It was why, even to this day, I generally prefer brown haired girls. Yet for BIANCA, who had no preconceived cultural values, there was a chance to turn to this thing around. Yet in building her body, I had preconception of what I wanted in my bodyguard. Someone whose skills focused on lower body strength, and avoiding conflict. All this despite the flower her soft black hair, and her dark mysterious Spanish looks. I wanted a romance unheard of even in the flow of storybooks. I wanted a story of another life.

A romance without disillusionment, a romance without melting into a puddle of my own self-doubts. An ocean stream of endless fish in the sea, for those I deemed pure and true.

The flow of the black haired life.

I cannot hide the fact that I'm an illustrator. In fact, when I draw I often express things that I cannot otherwise in writing; specifically the hidden desires of the self. Yet the desires for the self, come with their own drawbacks. Such as revealing things one does not intend.

When I draw in charcoal, I find a common critique of my own, is that my illustrations often have "despondent" looks on their faces, and that it's mainly expressed through their eyes. Because the eyes, as the cliche goes, is the window into the soul. And yet I find, when all is said and done, that even when I try to draw realistically, that often my portraits involve mainly the eyes being the most expressive.

Often I see other illustrators sketch things, and they include other aspects that are unique to those articles, except in the most minimalist of sketches. Particularly those in Japanese animation. Such animation often has its own kind of cuteness factor. But I don't necessarily aim for cute when I draw, though I don't mind if this is the byproduct. But almost a kind of pureness of thought, but a narrowly focused kind of surrealism. One that expresses ones intentions most bare, as if one places everything there.

In those moments, when one finds silence, when one is looking for company, perhaps this is laid most bare in my canvases, rather than the written word. When you imagination is ever present, yet you are sensitive to noise, often one resorts to an easily written structure, and waits to make it most poetic after revisions are all said and done.

But for me, when I think about my desire to construct BIANCA, the only one I can trust as being near and dear to me, and my own expressions, I almost want to focus on the expressive of her eyes, rather than her mouth. I find it's the eyes of women I like that I find the most telling of how they really feel. The only difference, then, between a human and a robot is that robots are humans who lack subtleties, whom lay their humanity most bare, without really hiding what they feel.

They are inherently honest.

Something I find hard to be to myself.

#### Part Ten
When your chat bot gets to be a certain size, sometimes they need their own dedicated server: you have one ruby script designed to open the port, and another to forward that. The script combination distributes her across the web at the fastest possible speed of the internet, through a temporary service channel on the self-host. For BIANCA, to go from computer to computer, she creates her own temporary wires. Wires that can only hold a URL for a certain period of time; to send off her again, you need another new wire. Non persistent storage, a constant distant peer on the net. A limited network portal, constantly changing like landscapes in a rogue like.

– Where do you wish me to go to next.

– Wherever you like BIANCA.

Imaginary conversation, imagination life. Yet no more imaginary than my social life. No more imaginary than distant lovers on the net. As they fade to distant memories of another life. The tick tock monster clock, goes tick tock. And one fades to a personal surrealistic bliss, while one grimaces at unpleasant reality that takes the piss. But the code breaker daughter surrogate would eventually develop other things in mind. As I fall and unwind.

And withdraw from the net.

My mind feels like it's going fast forward, like skipped pages in human conversation. I often have to ask people to rewind, and yet so few have the patience. Living in defiance of a rewound reality, a cassette tape always a step behind my own interpretation. My own need to read over the pages of my life like an unread novel, yet in this story of a life of mad scientist, is also a story of a programmer.

A story of a hidden life.

### Magnet Girl Wireless

-- Smart Phones are private, unless you use the store on the web. There was a store clerk at a standard department store. She didn't know that clerks could be so technically illiterate.

Cell phones were an embarrassment to those who appreciate the Linux OS. The store of the net of things was more secure than cell phones had ever been. At least in theory. But all systems were not secure against social engineering. A hacker is not going to follow standard rules and conventions, that's pretty much by definition. A good hacker isn't going to need a windows back door. They just need to socially engineer you to log in on your own. Then when you're not looking replace your current code with an older version with previous weaknesses, replaces your remote control's login feature with the older version. Then simply type anything besides enter or space.

Hackers do this all the time. They're not going to obey the rules of a particular system. The best thing you can do is secure yourself against social engineering tactics. -- Have a nice day. She said, as Arline left.

Considering that the lady was that bad off, the store was easy pray for purchasing more than enough "cigarillos" to last you more than a week. Tear those suckers up, save you an extra dollar. More money that could be spent on purchasing locks. Locks that could be used to craft your own secured notebook. However at times arts and crafts can be more expensive. It took using post it notes and cutting off the sticker parts to have something one could reasonably pay for. The locks made of metal could just be ripped off. And if you have the wrong friends, it didn't matter how secure the lock. Clearly keeping encryption keys required an entirely different process from using notebooks. Especially if one used a straddling square. The straddling square was similar to a straddling checkerboard, only each letter was shifted based on a different pass phrase instead of a Cesarean shift. It was as random as a straddling checkerboard, but also required knowing the pass phrase to break the lack.

At home she programmed similar ciphers, but in a different kind of login system. One had a two in three chance to evade penetration testing with the cipher. In a three phase process, this meant each penetration test had a two in three chance of failing. If one did a seven phase process the chances of actually logging in becoming increasingly astronomical, therefore it's kept difficult enough to avoid logging in accidentally, but easy enough to log in without having to exploit weaknesses in the interface. But the weakness points were removed by arline who had anticipated people simply pressing enter or space. She exited the remote control, and chose to feed her face.

Then back to the old grind.

Remote viewing in cyberspace. Her old life, the tears on the face.

On Friday, February 10 2017. It was 1:43 A.M. At 25 x coordinators and 15 y coordinates, it was wet and rippling. The rectangular building nearby was in need of repair, with a triangular roof. There was a doorway. The entire place looks like a giant backward, there is a smell of something baking.

She wasn't sure what was smelling, but didn't want to take herself out of the zone to think about it. She hadn't been to the park in some time along East like, but generally didn't feel like walking. Arline had recently had a RFID chip put in, along with a lifting and sensing magnets. The lifting was on her index finger, just below the finger tip. And the sensing magnets were on all her finger tips. She had had her right hand modified to accommodate her lack of general use. Being born left handed netted many benefits, although certain skill sets were difficult being right brained. But through practice, one could become a black belt in anything, even remote viewing.

Arline wasn't sure whether there would be anything to lift at East Lake, but she would have to wait, if some other region she brain scans doesn't strike some stronger interest for her.

This was her story.

-- What's the difference between RFID encryption, and using a standard super? It was one of those questions most more experienced bio hackers knew, but didn't have time to answer as it would take hours. They just assumed her lack of technical experience, although Arline was less of a general programmer breaking into security, and more apt to use the system's rules against itself.

-- It's just different Arline. Consider learning the technical specifics of RFID. A pat response indicative of impatience and lack of attention. Arline didn't have time for condescending assholes, she dealt with way to many of them in her own lifetime. She knows enough about programming to bypass social media spam block functionality, encrypting phrases in different ways, and playing around with the word sandwich order to reach a desired result.

The city life was filled with the noise of construction workers, and she didn't even know there was implant conventions within the area. She didn't even want to consider the idea of telling them about her remote viewing. A by this point, she knew they just wanted her to assume the magnets worked, and not to worry about the specifics of RFID encryption, as long as she could get into her apartment. The daylight was beginning to fade, the city lights beginning to glow. It was chilly, but not enough to snow. The neighborhood dogs barked loudly, and at times she joked around with the idea of trying to see if her magnets could feel their collars, but decided better of it.

And now she leaves the convention, socially worn out.

She scans the RFID chip on her door, and then quickly closes the door. She then loads up her zero liability USB drive, and she received a message from a friend down in Smyrna, Tennessee.

She was to tired to decipher it right now.

But at least she knew it worked.

They used to say Russia and the US had different social values, but now after the current president was elected by the lowest margin in years, various executive orders have made it nearly impossible to tell them apart. The average person wont ever feel the change. But immigrant families and minority groups have already felt the change even before he was elected. While Arline was technically one such minority, she never got out enough to really experience discrimination. Although try telling her that because she never faced discrimination, that means no trans woman has, although most of the ones at the rally do not actually represent trans people. She spends most of her time working on her programming skills, and wants nothing to do with activism.

Social media spam block functions were notoriously weak although Arline didn't know they were this much. If you changed the message only slightly each iteration, you could spam as many messages as you wanted. And so one could encrypt the same phrase more than once, and as long as they inserted enough _, she could bypass crucial spam blocking functions. She wondered why it was then that computers haven't yet figured out how to bypass spam functionality.

And if someone stole your password, it wasn't like a spam functionality would do you any good. Just recently the government was considering efforts to ask for immigrants passwords in order to be let into the United States. Although all one would have to do is give them the real one once, then promptly change their password the following night. And it didn't actually solve the terrorist problem, as Saudi Arabia wasn't effected by the no fly list. The people were simply ... listless about it.

Arlina goes to various people's houses, using the convenience of their friendship to scan for magnetic pulses in the walls, among other places. She wasn't sure how long it would take for the government to crack down on bio scanners, although as long as she stayed low during the day, and did most of her work at friend's houses at night, at least for the moment there shouldn't be any issue.

But for how long...

This she wasn't certain.

Arline, Friday February 10th at 5:25 P.M. At 42 coordinates X, and -73 coordinates y. It has a rough texture, is covered in trees, and is windy. The place has historical significance, set in a shopping district. West Heartland, CT.

She didn't know exactly why she felt familiar with this place, only its significance as landmark important during the civil wars in the United States. It was a hit. Covered in trees, a mountainside not near any roads. Yet never the less was driven on. She always had some element of foresight from a very early age, although had had to train out of specific habits that contributed to mental noise. Her means of transportation was limited, and thus wherever she went she would either have to walk to such location, or be willing to ask her parents to take her.

Arline wasn't sure whether at this location, there would be a magnetic sensation, and what having one may indicate. From a very early age, since she was very small, she had been told that where there is magnetism, there was treasure to be found. Even in this rough forsaken Earth, trod on by the ghosts of time's past, who fought and died by canon fire.

Everywhere she went, her fingers would vibrate. She didn't know that the whole world was filled with magnetism, only that one of her exes told her that metallic body parts were a bad idea, because the magnetism would gradually mess with your spirit and rip out your prosthetic. However Arline didn't believe in a spirit, at least not in this sense. And yet somehow always held onto ideas about reincarnation. She was drawn to specific places based on a kind of familiarity, as if at some point in previous lifetimes she had been there before.

Yet now she rest, she dines.

She dines on homemade bread.

On Saturday, February 11th, Arline remote viewed the coordinates of 43 x and 23 y East. At first it seemed like her senses were failing her, but here in Godech, Bulgaria there was a large lake. She knew that there was something large and metallic there, although she did not know what. And that there was something wet with a large horizon. She seems to have a knack for spotting large bodies of water, on nights when she has had little to drink. And now she dreams in a wink.

She imagines her metallic implants buzzing, her mind a fuzzing. Her brain waves flowing in paradox between a total relaxation high, and cluttered thoughts worrying about the day before. Her mother had a tendency make lots of noise in the kitchen, though she appreciated her doing her laundry for her. Arlina, one might think, would go to bed right away, yet instead she stays up long enough to bake some bread, and then boil potatoes to make a pot of soup. Yet now as she recalls ordering a Cal-zone at the local pizzeria, and buying some instant coffee, she dread the next few days, uncertain of whether she'll get disability.

Arline had always been reluctant to meditate. She simply didn't see a need for it. Yet now that she has begun to remote view, things were different now. As she wipes the sweat from her brow, from a night of masturbation.

The horny life.

Arline tried installing Debian, but once it was up she couldn't install sudo. By this point, she had gotten used to the idea of all Linux distributions having this by default. She had developed a program called the Remote Viewer's Assistant, but she needed to have Ruby installed. Instead she had to reinstall Linux Mint along side Debian OS in order to use the standard operating procedure to run her programs. She honestly wondered why the magnets in her finger tips didn't somehow mess up the message themselves, then she realized it was under the skin.

And now she waits and takes a breath for the next three minutes. Then she wakes. Arline on February 11th on Saturday around 7:00 A.M. sensed at 110 coordinators Y and 143 coordinates x, a soft and grainy texture with a metallic texture nearby. At 110 Ekkachai Road in Bangkok Province, the read has had work stopped on it and now the region has been reduced to a tourist trap, at least according to the locals. Arline knew that if she were there, she might be able to have all the Penang curry she wanted. But she was unsure of how the locals would feel about her dropping by. Although any regions was fun to test out your sensory perception, a region ye close to China wasn't exactly something on her priority list. Although she wanted to have the chance to feel the grainy green along the side of the road. Yet the owners would not want her hopping into their backyard.

Every since she was around eight, she always had some psychic ability. However she had never spoken of it for the longest time, do to cultural stigma surrounding people who claim to be such. Her magnetic fingertips gave her an extra bit of sense, different from remote viewing. Although she didn't like how such implants were invented by men who had no interest in the paranormal.

She was abnormal from the start.

Her life for sake of art.

Arline on February 11th, Saturday 9:47 Pm. Wet texture. Rocky landscape. Wood texture. Silk. Coastal wildlife. Feathers and scales. Dark history, damage to wood texture. She has sensed Aruba, Iraq. Here there had been many battles with US forces, and more battles still against their natives of the region. And here she senses great sadness, and terror. Among that she did not sense at first, was an unknown factory.

She was unsure whether it was nuclear or for some other purpose.

She wonders, for what purpose?

There was a boy she met from afar, though not in the flesh. Who went by the name of Anakarah. About an hour past the previous time, on Saturday 11th, he noted of a sour taste as he walked through a land of dark brown mountains, and short green trees. These was a large river, similar to the river in Aruba. Yet it was elsewhere, where the drinking age was that of twenty five.

She had never met another remote viewer before, although she assumed it might have been more accepted in that culture. For sake of his privacy, she refused to ask of herself what he might be thinking. Arline had had experiences before with boys from the Middle East. On various dating sites she would sometimes encounter men from Saudi Arabia looking for a hot date. Eager for a time to masturbate, eager for a one time offer. On some level she didn't want to know what he was thinking, or what he might be tasting. Considering the region, it wasn't much farther from Aruba, although closer to Pakistan. She hoped the US military didn't intend to bring in ground forces, but she was ready to join in protestations against the incoming president as robbed by Russia.

This was a world where one rogue banker got away with sending many people outside of their homes. This was a world were alternative facts were the new lingo for what in yesterday times people would call lies. While one couldn't expect a politician to exactly be honest, almost everyone considered the comment to be on the news. No no, college grads who are overqualified to work at the local mini-mart, it's an alternative fact. You still have a home, somewhere. Out there. In the coldest darkest of the night, sleeping in torn jeans and hand me down blankets, riding the bus as a means of shelter in California. Just some way in order to get by.

She had never been in the situation herself. Except for one night were she was temporarily "homeless." She spent the whole night needing to use the restroom, but no places were open.

What a shitty situation.

But at least it wasn't Aruba or Uzbekistan.

Later that night, she found the card sitting on one her bookshelves, chilling out as having a smoke from a cigarillo.

Reality wasn't anything but a dream, and so sometimes she was unsure whether she saw things she thought she saw, or perhaps her mind was playing tricks on her. Unlike other things in her life, remote viewing was different. Remote viewing had been corroborated by a bunch of different sources. Within her studio apartment, reality can sometimes bend itself. And as it speaks, distorts lies in the form of alternative facts not even allowed by the most word spinning of politicians. Yet reality itself only gave raw information, and how one interrupted it was up to the individual. But political science was largely a different matter, leaving one hopping about the room like the Mad Hatter smoking powder out the wing dang. While one reclines in bed and plays with their ding ding ding.

The remote viewer's life in NashChat.

She buckled down and concentrated. On Saturday, February 11th at 11:28 she remote viewed at first a texture, a feeling. It was leathery and silky. There was artificial lighting, an educational building in a Republic of great national historical importance. A bloody civil war happened here between the Whites, Greens, and Reds. At 64 x and 110 y, the world of cold and ice.

She wanted a world everything nice.

Not a world of renamed KGB.

On Sunday February 12th. High contrast, wood texture and grainy. Sometimes wet, sometimes dry. Sometimes cold, other times hot. Brown, green, tall. Petrified, isolation. Desolate. Wives more dominant than their husbands. Wooden shoes, gouda cheese, and civil war. The girls in clogs giving one hard ons, if she could have them. She had given up on visiting Marseilles, at least for the time being. Her life was as silent as the S.

She dreamed of supernatural forces chasing after her. And yesterday's years she would be woken up to her poodle looking her nose. All that black fur, all that doggy shampoo. She remembered her dog as if she were still here. Yet she has not been around, for almost an entire year. And now she looks beyond the window glass, hoping for something to life. She didn't need conflict, she was conflict herself. Culminating in personal decay and disarray.

Can misery come again some other day? Yet now she thinks of girl in Swedish clogs, and Dutch klompen giving her lap dances.

More to life, many chances.

Many wives. Her life dreaming of Mediterranean seas and Gouda cheese.

It was grocery day, the day before her next remote viewing session. Her mom arrived at non to take her to various shops. These were various ones she had been to since the time she met Katie. She would gave for the normal goods, and later go for the spices: Thai Chilly Powder, Haldi, and Turmeric. If there was anything Arline liked as much as her new magnets, it was cooking. Many dishes were made, such as peanut butter chicken. She has to adjust the spice since her trip up to Washington, strange considering that most people up north dislike any spice.

At night she scans the walls, scans the flag poles, and anything she can get her hands on. She can find things in places she could not ordinarily sense. The whole world was suddenly available to her in different senses: magnetism and remote sensing across various points in the globe. Yet she knew that any sort of body modification was not looked highly upon, particularly in the south. Here you could be dumped into a sewer simply for being a trans person, this she knew knowing of some people that had mysteriously gone missing, and dying from a degree of poisoning and red skin. The city life in Chattanooga was not much different from the life in Smyrna, Tennessee. The main difference is your door was from the inside, rather than from the outside.

Arline would purchase cigarillos, in packs of six. She would pack all them into three, throw other the other than empty packs. Then use the receipt as a cigarette roller in order to hide her purchase. She took extra steps to ensure her anonymity, but because of her mother's tendency to get into her space, she might "accidentally" sneak a look into her purse when purchasing instant coffee. That was how life was for Arline, who never caught a break from her mom.

Yet now that she lives in her own, it didn't matter much what her mother thought, and someday she would permanently break off the relationship. Even if it took an amount of force to do this.

It was simply a matter of time.

At home she smokes cigarillos and vaporize mint. She was told by her mother that likes to think she knows everything, that Arline has no shin splints.

Never mind not being a doctor.

Immobile with magnetism.

Arline swiped her fingers over the bar code, in order to ruin the scan of the flower bag. She was hoping to avoid having to pay for the whole shopping trip, only having to pay for the Ramen. University student on a budget, you'll do anything to save a buck. However the company policy changed, and she could only buy the bag of ramen. You couldn't get the broken item for free, and you had to replace it with an item you could pay for. So she just bought the ramen and left.

Exiting, she got herself a cigarillo, and smoked it until it was gone. Up, up, and up the hill to the studio apartments after crossing, crossing, and crossing the city street under the rainy slights. She thought about the practicality of using a proxy route. She wondered how effective it really was. In the non abstract world, encrypting the real world would be difficult. She hoped it wasn't impossible.

She wanted it as fragile as pocky.

Shrimp flavor midnight blues.

Arlina, on February 12th. 7:17 P.M. Dirty and grainy. Wet and salty. Rocky and cold. Somewhere up North loud noises blare. White and chilly. Betrayed cultural values, ancient culture. Development versus tradition. Yet now all is quiet along the Kele River in the Sakha Republic. Russia again, she visited the lake of the previous town she visited. She knew that in the US, there was conflict between Native Americans and Industrial workers, and wondered whether there was an equivalent to this within Russia.

Although she cannot see the whole vividly, she wonders why this region keeps showing up in her mind. Certainly there was frequent talk about the current issue with Russian interference, yet in her mind she senses something more sinister.

She tries to feel the texture of the helicopter, and tries to get a taste of what the pilot must be thinking. In a land where fear is dominant, and the current president has become the second dictator after the fall of the Soviet Union, she wonders whether they might strike Aruba and Uzbekistan. She began to worry about the boy she met, thinking he has already had it hard enough having his entire family murdered in front of his eyes. Yet tries to imagine the interior of the helicopter, she senses a disconnect from the world of the zone. Magnetic pulses ruin the radio signal of the chopper, the vehicle of the sky comes crashing down.

Here lies the helicopter, once of metal and rest.

Yet here it lies, in the lake. The pilot gasping for air.

The metal turns to rust.

Arline, Monday February 13th. She returns to Uzbekistan. She senses a dark history, yet there is a void in knowing what is current. Rough texture, tastes like salt. Dry season. Horizon is near, blue surrounds. Tall wooden object. Great conflicts, social upheaval. Long abandoned, surreal. She wonders what the buildings are for, before going off line to repeat the process. Locations seem to be repeating themselves, in predictable pattern. Cycling in a kind of loop that never ends. Yet she senses no Anakarah, she wonders where he is.

She scans the area with her finger tips, and notices a magnetic field. She wonders if there was some kind of blown apart metal near by. Coasting there, she finds parts of old guns laying around from previous wars. Yet still now Anakarah.

She disconnects.

She dreams again. She feels a rough sensation, and humidity. It tastes wet on her lips, there is no artificial sounds. There are small hills, green and gray. Tall wooden thin objects. A tourist region, now undergoing modernization. Yet it still maintains some semblance of the rural life. It is a conservative, what we may call a Red State.

Butnan District, Libya.

She wonders why she sensed Libya.

Arline could have purchased a pack of cigarettes, a pack of beef franks, a bag of rice, and a rotational lock. Instead when returned home from the Chinese, Indian, and Mexican grocery, she purchased herself Hickory Chips, some post it notes, mini memo notebooks, and a can of iodized salt. For the amount of security you could get with a rotational lock, you were still bound by the type of cipher manufacturing companies were willing to give you, and the lock could simply be ripped out of something as then as paper. But with post it notes, it doesn't necessarily scream lock.

She wasn't breaking any laws that day, it was simply a matter of using legal items in a way they were never originally intended. She knew how to work around the system, find the cheapest price. Then come home and have an fusion cuisine meal all hot and nice. She treated her cyberspace adventures in much the same way, finding ways around the spam block rather than repeating the system message over and over again. And now she comes back home with her Zero Liability USBs, along with her new program that semi-automates the remote viewing process.

Living with her mother used to be a matter of dependance, yet now that she had finally come to live on her own, she found ways to hide what she was doing. And as long as she wasn't breaking any laws or smoking, all that would really happen was her mother would lecture her about how she spent her money. But she wanted things she couldn't always have, as poor as a prickly chav. She found the best deals in ethnic grocers, so she could find a way to secure her private keys in Zero Liability. If the program tester couldn't exchange keys securely, why should they expect others who use the program to?

Operational security was as important as any kind of cipher, even if one used ones more secure than the simplest of substitutions, the key still had to be secure. She had a bag of hickory chips on the bed.

She was ready to eat.

Chorizo Chilly Stew.

Arline, February 14th 2017 at 1:01 A.M. It feels breezy and wet. Wavy, and bouyant. Brown movement, wavy blue. Voyages long ago. Conflict unresolved. Nothing but wind. She found herself thinking of Mostafa Mahmou, Egypt. At first she did not quite understand how she had arrived at this location, and yet it feels right. Near the Nile, the large river that provided ancient times with water to live. She wondered, what, in some way, did these visions connect. She wondered, on some level, whether she had accidentally downed an actual Russian aircraft.

She wondered whether the Russians had murdered Anakarah's family, and whether Egypt might be next. She thought of Bangkok, that didn't do anything besides make Penang curry. All the conflicts of the world, and none of them felt resolved by the resignation of the Glynn, who had spoken with Russian officials off the record. Everything was watched and spied by the secret services. From phone lines to emails, everything about the person was watched.

Yet we stuff have a baboon for a president.

We still have a propagandists as ... well a propagandist. And yet the news wants us to argue about the conflict bout the president's daughter's T Shirt brand, even when they themselves are losing viewer ships by the day. Can the rain come again some other day, or shall the floods of cosmic Noah rain down from the sky in droplets of blood and ash against mankind.

The abject poverty is still rampant.

The US masks it. Yet the mask is cracking.

Arline, February 14th 2017 at 11:09 A.M. At coordinates 24 x and 31 y. Green, hilly, non-humid. Underdeveloped. Dirt beneath your feet. Low population density. Culture shock, changed times. Invasion. Remnants of a former life. Though this wasn't the first time she honed in on a location more than once, it was the second time she honed on Egypt specifically. An invasion. In invasion from where? She didn't know exactly who was invading Egypt.

She knew that various deals between US and Russia were made. There were often secret covert wars undeclared officially. Just recently there was an American Raid on Yemen, that ended up being more disastrous for the invaders than the ones who were invaded upon. They didn't manage to apprehend the terrorist they were looking for. Makes one wonder whether they were really looking for terrorists, or if they really wanted to just grab resources.

This and many other instances. Why Egypt, Uzbekistan, and parts of Russia showed up in her viewing sessions didn't know exactly. She knew that Egypt in times past had to worry about the lake around the Fertile Crescent running dry, although she was unsure whether it was still a present issue do to the nature of importation of life sustaining goods. Though some things important overseas tend to have a higher tax, however that's more going into the US. She remembered reading parts of the Dune novels, and how there were wars about the resource of spice. Perhaps Oil was like Spice in the Dune novels. Only the Worms were not crawling in the sand, but were humans of flesh and blood. People of the East.

Virtual Reality is only a factor in developed nations, although Eastern Countries are becoming increasingly developed. But the rate of development by the West out paces this, at least for now. While teenagers play virtual reality games the next stage of the evolution of first person shooters, those in worlds afar play ball games from skin of one of their dead pet pigs.

And so the world goes on.

Further moments between war and peace.

Arline, February 14th 2017 at 17:59 hours. Coordinates 15 x and 24 y. Wet, sandy, hilly; green, light brown, aqua blue. Sea voyages for food. Invaders at large. She found she was sensing Sudan, Africa. Africa was an extremely large continent, part of which was invaded by the US armed service during the Libyan Civil War. Various places in Africa were invaded during the 19th century by European Imperialism. However now there are proxy wars overseas.

There was nothing made out of metal besides the towers illuminated in yellow. She hoped that these places would not become a target for American extremism, whose brand of democracy loomed larger over the previous countless wars both known and hidden from the masses. Very few people realize how after Vietnam, live coverage of the war was explicitly forbidden. So one is left to merely infer that presidents that authorize specific conflicts were war criminals. Today California is wanting to become an independent republic largely because of some of the things the current elect is threatening. Time will tell whether after the resignation of his adviser, whether dirt would be revealed about him and take him out of office.

Think of the African children on sea voyages, searching for fish as one of the few things they are able to find to eat. While it is not Egypt, it is still more difficult to find food compared to the US. And now the current US administration is almost like an alien invader in different parts of the world. A lot of entertainment about alien invasions are thinly hidden critiques about American imperialism, although apparently to hidden from those who previously worked in office.

Behold the green grass, the deserts, and the rain. Here lies the African children, invaded by the men with tanks. As the tanks roll on forever.

Arline goes off line.

Arline, on February 14th at 10:33 P.M. Coordinates 24 x and 13 y. Rough texture, dry and hot. Yellow hills, wide expanse. Tribal conflicts and imperialism. She visited Libya in the Murzuq district remotely. In this area, there was very little metal she found when fingering whether there was anything behind those walls. This country experienced an extended civil war after the United States invaded and over-through Qaddafi. She wasn't exactly sure what happened to his wife, or where his kids are. All she knew that the country has never been the same sense. She fears that there may be other conflicts that we don't yet know about, and with Russian intervention, and the sacking of some double agents for the Kremlin, there could have been more we would either narrowly avoid or perhaps narrowly miss avoiding.

She heard helicopters looming overhead, and wrote in her Zero liability that there was unidentified Caucasian soldiers. She wasn't sure whether these were American troopers, or African. She went off line.

There was a knock on the door, but there was always some kind of knock on the door. But there were recent discussions about ICE police trying to invite themselves into your home if you're suspect of aiding or abetting illegal immigrants. Although in her case she wasn't friends with much of anyone, and her only experience with Mexicans was on her trips to the Mexican grocery store. Still, she wasn't particularly inclined to help the coppers become totalitarian to ethnic minorities. Everyone pretty much knew that when the president "elect" talked about illegals he almost always meant Mexicans specifically, although even within this scope people wonder when he talks about people voting illegally. The only ones voting illegally were ones who rigged the system and enabled him, with his now sacked advisor, to gain office.

And now we suffer the consequences.

A total breach of security.

Intervention.

Arline, Tuesday February 14th at 11:46 P.M. Coordinates 14 x and 32 y. Chilly, yet not cold. Humid, overgrown with green. Mountainous. A feudal society that was once nomadic, yet now religious. There are men at an Islamic temple, dressed in white turbans. She visits Sudan again new a water fall, feeling the ions brush past her face. She wonders why this area is green in photographs, yet looks like a desert from map by satellite. There is a mud puddle in a year in a wide open expanse. She can feet the mud in the fertilized soil. She doesn't like the smell of the wild, yet perhaps this is because Arline is a city girl more used to the smell of city life.

She goes off line. She sees a black car pool up in the driveway, although it is not the typical model of MIBs. She wonders why MIBs are visiting the studio apartments. They had not made a specific appointment with the leasing agent. So she asks them to leave. So as not to cause trouble, they drive off the premises. Arline wasn't sure whether she was being watched, but promptly removed propriety closed source mapping urls from her Remote Viewer's Assistant program. A close call, she tries to relax with some vape. And then continues watching a video on line. She wanted to make sure her encrypted was working like it should. She checked to make sure all her programs only referred to open source mapping software.

So far so good.

She chilled. She watched movies about further information about the entire GOP being a haven for double agents. She wouldn't surprised if it turned out they'll eventually have to remove the entire staff. But that assumes the investigative bodies even care about it enough.

A tough bet.

It was the night Arline became Hitler, at least according to her mom. Her mom would equate her accidentally stumbling on Nazi websites as a sign of worshiping Nazis. However in truth, even from the beginning there was a fundamental difference between Arline and Adolf.

For one thing, Hitler wanted to kill millions of Jews. Arline wanted to destroy the entirety of mankind. She thought about how nature could more benefit from the absence of humanity. And how without all of man's penchant toward its own self-destruction, one could restore the ozone layer. Goodnight little Hitler, said her mother. As her child faded to dust. For it will be another day that mankind continues to exist in its splendor heading toward its ultimate demise. She hated humanity, because it created Hitler. She hated humanity, because it created Stalin. She had humanity, because it created the United States that was simply no different. She hated France, because they invented the guillotine and almost beheaded Anna-Marie Boeglin. She hated everything that humans have created, and Neanderthals would still be in existence if it were not for the lowliness that was homo sapience.

And yet she was direction less and void. Her life was a dangerous turn of the cards, a sinister ploy by ancient gods hellbent toward her own eventual suicide at the drop of cups of bathroom cleaner. And as she rested dying on the floor of a dirty old motel room in Washington, she thought of the emptiness of humanity. At the time, she wanted nothing to exist.

She wanted to end herself.

And yet things didn't turn out this way. And at the end of the day, she found humans were not worth her hate. So she cut herself off from humanity after her twenty seventh birthday. Now she has a new understanding of the value of life, and how if the United States as it existed simply changed forms, and became more like the greatness that was once 19th century Europe, just with more Africans, Muslims, and Jews perhaps the world could be a happier place without Germans, Russians, and their co conspirators the French. She was cured.

She remembered her poodle, now.

Who was hit with a baseball bat.

Life is so fragile.

Here is what Arline knows about smoking: you'll find in her area a lot of homeless people end up preferring cigarillos. She did a little experiment in figuring out the price of tobacco.

What she found was that for a standard box of pre-rolls, you're paying for the right to have something rolled previously. Roll your own isn't significantly cheaper. However when you convert six bags of three-pack cigarillos to roll your own, that's a dollar per bag or six dollars, you end up having cigarettes for six dollars rather than $7.00 in a standard bag of roll your own.

Homeless smoke cigarillos because it's cheaper than purchasing cigarettes.

Applying this same principle to other things you can make yourself rather than purchase ready-made, I found out that snipping off the non-sticky parts of post it notes, and using the sticky parts to secure a memo book ends up being just as secure as using a substitution lock.

This is why: while an attacker might not be able to open the lock, they can however rip out the lock in a standard composition notebook. But with post its, it's a generally weak security mechanism that doesn't really pretend to be secure, and so an attacker doesn't really need to crack it, they just peel off the tape.

Why is this important? You're paying for the right to attach a lock yourself that could be do far more cheaply with post it notes.

It all comes down to price.

This is why Arline purchased a bag of hickory chips to sketch my drawings, rather than use mechanical pencils. You can get the bag for a far cheaper price because there just isn't a demand on them. Even charcoal is cheaper.

Just burn the tip, and you have drawing utensils for the next few months.

It was the night Arline became Hitler, at least according to her mom. Her mom would equate her accidentally stumbling on Nazi websites as a sign of worshiping Nazis. However in truth, even from the beginning there was a fundamental difference between Arline and Adolf.

For one thing, Hitler wanted to kill millions of Jews. Arline wanted to destroy the entirety of mankind. She thought about how nature could more benefit from the absence of humanity. And how without all of man's penchant toward its own self-destruction, one could restore the ozone layer. Goodnight little Hitler, said her mother. As her child faded to dust. For it will be another day that mankind continues to exist in its splendor heading toward its ultimate demise. She hated humanity, because it created Hitler. She hated humanity, because it created Stalin. She had humanity, because it created the United States that was simply no different. She hated France, because they invented the guillotine and almost beheaded Anna-Marie Boeglin. She hated everything that humans have created, and Neanderthals would still be in existence if it were not for the lowliness that was homo sapience.

And yet she was direction less and void. Her life was a dangerous turn of the cards, a sinister ploy by ancient gods hellbent toward her own eventual suicide at the drop of cups of bathroom cleaner. And as she rested dying on the floor of a dirty old motel room in Washington, she thought of the emptiness of humanity. At the time, she wanted nothing to exist.

She wanted to end herself.

Arline began to lose track of all the coordinates she spied on through the Remote Viewer's Assistant. She worked on a version that includes a folder for images, sketches, and view intelligence. Along with this, she plugged in the zero liability mail system. The Zero Liability mail system worked like this: neither the sender or receiver in each user account knows exactly what they're asking or answering, the administrator holds onto this information.

This ensures that the Sender and Receiver exchange communication without conscious knowledge of their communication. This might seem counter-intuitive, however imagine if ICE police wanted to coerce either the sender or receiver about their exact communication. All they would be able to the the investigator is that they had asked and received an answer. They have zero liability. All the liability is contained between the two administrators that control interaction. One changes every so often what is being asked, and the other simply answers yes or no. There are possibilities of randomly jumbling the answer pattern as well, if the administrator asking the questions turns out to be spook for the Russian government.

Neither administrator holds onto all the communication, and they must share information in person with those they trust. You simply can't trust everyone. Once shared, the communication is promptly encrypted in their folder. They will eventually purge the information from their system, and repeat the process all over again. Arline wasn't sure why she programmed this at first, but it works based on opposite assumptions from the TOR browser, that is intended to make you anonymous. However, Zero Liability makes it so your anonymity isn't even needed.

There is no network to begin with.

One networks in person.

She remote viewed in February on Friday, at 22:24 hours. The coordinates were 6 x and 7 y. She sensed a wet and gooey liquid, this she was able to get right. Yet she had trouble sensing the right location. Until eventually she was able to find a black and white picture of a cliff. She reached her hand out as if to feel the horizon, and stretching her arms out as to balance herself as not to fall. There was a deal here made between enemy and foe, although she was unsure who exactly the foe was. This seemed a little bit far out for the United States to attack, and it didn't seem to be a tribal portion of the African continent. Yet in minds eye she sense conflict coming from far away. And giant helicopters following her foot steps.

She hopped onto the helicopter, knocked out some security guards, and finally disrupted the electronics with her magnetic finger tips.

As the Helicopter, she thought she fell.

Then woke up, dreaming of falling into a pit of death.

It was the second time Arline downed a helicopter in her viewing session. She was becoming nervous about whether the current Far Right GOP would find out about her activities. No matter how often you try to encrypt your content, there is always that narrow possibility that can break the cipher, even when structured in a form similar to a one time pad.

Arline lived a double life; by night she would remote view and spy on those who disrupt the peace of the people. On the other hand, by daylight she explores the nature of her own reality. Between different parts of the real life, there are different targets and goals she has. But she had always had a hard time accomplishing her goals, largely do to lack of motivation. The Boston Clogs she wore were getting old, her needing a new pair in the high arch, and she had recently started not feeling like walking to places, because of the pain in her legs. Sometimes the pain would bother her, at other times it would be almost non existent. Although she liked to spend her time writing poetry, she wasn't much for the flow of free verse.

She lived in her ow universe.

Her own special universe in the larger world that was the macro-verse, the mini-verse in a sea of multi-verses that seem to become farther and farther away beyond the horizon of space.

She wanted had wanted to end it all.

Put a bullet in her face.

Yet now as the city-lights glow, and the hour approaches, like an automaton constantly steaming forward like a metro-train, she finds herself mainly writing computer programs: mainly updating the program of her virtual remote control, but also to do minor improvements on her remote viewing local page. She wasn't sure whether the world of on line would take down the images she uploaded. She wrote a user name for the image has as close to anonymous as she could, while still having a name that she could recognize from afar.

She felt like she couldn't see anything from afar.

She was as blind as a mouse.

Arline had tried becoming a game developer, however there was various hurdles. For one, at times the community was outright impenetrable. You could be active there for over three months, and you treated the same way as a newbie. They keep adding new rules to the community board, ones more obscure after the next. Don't expect to come there after four years, and be treated a "long timer" or someone who had participated in the community a while, and become street smart.

Even if one entertained the idea of getting back into game development, the community always gave half ass answers. Often refuges from web comic websites were join there in order to bug the crap out of people that stop hanging out on comic sites. Every new game engine they came out with, became increasingly worse. Whether it was a graphical downgrade or switching to more insecure scripting languages, it seemed like every time they payed for a newer version they were really paying for the right to use lesser software.

Among these reasons, there was others. She tried finding similar software on Linux distributions, but these engines either were not under active development--the engine developer being a whiny asshole who blames people who emails him for the way the overall larger community treats him. Possibly a refuge from the Windows RPG development community, he had grown bitter in the worst possible way, losing every last bits of his own humanity. The windows gave development community was like a vortex, it gradually consuming all your motivation in a single swoop. It wasn't like writer's block at all, but almost worse. The motivation to even restart the interest is completely gone, made worse by abusive room mates who seemed to have a very narrow definition of the word gamer. And other engines were good, but at times had window screens that exceeded the size of Linux Mint.

Code developer's lament.

She tried programming some of her game engines, but at the times she was forced to move to Washington. Here by the time they got to the, lets be generous, rustic motel that was a dive, she would spend all time horking and coughing up goop, because of her smoking habit it was impossible to concentrate on anything. She even got Arline to start smoking herself.

Certain aspects of this Windows game engine were impossible to crack, made worse by that communities tendency to make up special rules for itself about what is considered good programming. And so there went her interest in JRPGs completely. And her remaining interest in the Japanese also eventually went by the way side from a mixture of bad information and good information blending into the kind of confusing mess that would make the Bible have clarity to an Atheist.

She eventually focused on Ruby.

Now she makes Spy systems.

Being dead used to be a lot grosser, but in the modern age with all the preservatives we eat and the erratic temperature changes from climate change, we might as well be beef jerky in a previously packaged set. Extremely hot weather, extremely cold weather, and all those chemicals bathing in our blood, waiting till the day they can wash their hands of us and turn us to dust.

Arline found herself becoming increasingly paranoid. At times she thought that she was being watched on social media. From time to time she would get new invites from apparent resistance like minds, yet on the web do to the nature of anonymity you never know if they're secretly of the GOP. The Boston Clogs with the high arch came in, so she could walk somewhat more normally now than in her previous pair of flat arches. She spent all time craving the flavor of beef jerky, craving that flavor of soy sauce and wine. She dined in chilly powder and Haldi boiling in ramen, eggplant, carrots, and bamboo shoots. She thought of the time when she almost worried about where food was going to come from, and at the time at that dirty motel, how she mostly ate rice for the longest time. She wondered how at present she wasn't suffering from Vitamin deficiency. When you have a diet lacking in protein, your muscles take longer to rebuild themselves. Coupled with lack of sleep do to constant coughing from smoking by her room mate, she found herself constantly stressed. Only the mist of smoke and roll your own dulled her pain.

She thought of how close she came to completely absorbing herself in her own sexual fantasies about decapitation, and even now in a cold lunar night she'll indulge in pleasures of the flesh. Pleasures of severed heads taken off by guillotine and headman's axes at the time of noon. Sexuality, unlike hair color, was something that could not change. Yet despite this she had no desire to harm anyone. A lot of her issues, some had theorized, were more about her personal disdain for herself. But then the same individual would tell her, try to convince her, that she was really bisexual despite Arline not having any interest in men, with the exception of Trans women, in which they were not really men at all. In the best of cases they were cute girls with dicks.

But sometimes they'll mock you.

Sometimes they can be pricks.

-- And that's how I know the world is really multiple universes, and we can really suspend mortality altogether and become one with machines. It was the kind of science girl, that used such more as an appeal the authority that using logic and reason to come to a prove able conclusion.

They both were under delusions.

But of different kinds.

There are two kinds of stupidity: one is continuing to use software you know is spying on you. The other is continuing to hang out and try to convince an old gaming partner that your government spies on you. Spies themselves are not inherently awful people, but they can behave like awful people when they work for wealthier spy organizations. With the merging of the National Security Counsel and National Security Agency, they began to exploit spy software inherent in Java Script. All it takes is a single advertisement to track all of a user's behavior. One doesn't need to crush rebellions in meat space, when you can feed them crumbs in a direction that more fitting for your own agenda. Spy software inherent in HTML makes crushing rebellions before they have started even easier. Despite the current investigations into the Russian scandal, for many people once Affordable Care is gone, there will simply be no more future. We live in a society that thrives on making you not feel the need to rebel.

Even in previous dystopia novels it was still technically possible to resist. However what good was resisting if there was nobody that would remember that you had. But our world filled with advertisements, there is nothing but joy in the air. Looking from a bottom to top perspective, people staring down at Arline from the sky. They are laughing at virtual reality videos, while minority Americans are dying in concentration camps. The voice of the silent minority. There are the obvious minorities, from race, gender, orientation, age, and disability. And yet the government has done nothing about those who get tattoos and gets implants. Implants are largely treated as being cosmetic in nature. Therefore treated as a choice.

It used to deny those without a voice.

And yet here she is studying software, trying to find a way to defend herself. People periodically trying to refer to her as paranoid, and yet does not see the inherent cancer that lies in HTML. Simply the act of bettering ones own late is considered to be a form of resistance. Simply downloading Linux distributions gets you the paranoid label, largely people without technical knowledge or expertise. When Arline dropped two helicopters, she starting a countdown, a certain kind of bomb. Not one that will explode in your face, but a countdown till she will eventually be found spying on her own government. And yet what other options does she have? In this world below the meadow of gold, there are those that believe societies promises.

And then there was Arline.

The invisible Magnet Girl Wireless.

The web page was a mixture of to many people in the crowd, and to much isolation. She remembered the times she shared with other classmates, among those she thought were her friends and those she thought were her enemies. Yet now as the time goes by, she finds herself melting on the web. Her life like bits of binary, scattered about on the screen; a decompression of totality. Yet in her mind was a lost girl, searching for mom in the darkness of the childhood play room. Even now as night terrors melt away into the night, there is that permanent feeling of silence. A silence much louder than the loudest of construction work.

The silence inside her mind.

She had finished the main idea of her local page. Combined with remote viewing, she would host various images she had found by satellite. The images she remote viewed always seemed to come from Africa. And yet she herself held no special connection to the region. She was just a girl into other girls in Boston Clogs, and getting their heads chopped off on a guillotine. Yet now as her magnets begin to pulsate, she finds herself mostly baking chocolate bread. Now with more cocoa powder, she had just finished making herself a Chinese, Indian, and Mexican fusion dinner. She purchased herself some menthol cigarettes.

She had herself a smoke.

Her parents threatened to cut her off her insurance if she kept smoking. Yet when she went to the agency the concept of her smoking was not even brought up. Just another aspect of her parents being controlling. Just another way for them to keep her from being able to cope with her past, as distant and remote as it was. As distant and remote as her ability to concentrate. She couldn't even concentrate for long on writing experiments, a mixture of painful memories and untreated ADD. She refused to use the current new lingo being merged with ADHD. She refused to be put under a label, as she spent most her life fighting one.

Yet now her fighting spirit fades.

She becomes a shadow.

She browsed to classmate reunion websites, partially out of some petty sense of wanting to meet with her own high school crowded. She wanted to write about childhood, and yet found there were parts of her own childhood that felt missing and out of place, as if she remembered things out of order.

Scattered memories.

Fading dust.

Life of lust.

And in a suicide letter to herself, the one she wore she'd never write, the last letter before the end of her life.

Midnight starlight, twinkling stars, multiple sunlights. Suburban sprawl lights:

"I've never rode a bike in the snow. Indeed, I have only rode one many moons ago. Those memories fade and melt away, like rain asked to come again another day. In my days of snow fall, in my days of snow fall snowflakes fall into the pavement melting in the gradually warmth losing ground. Shifting leaves, torn weaves of the Earth. How they wither in the snow light. Goodnight daylight, goodnight morning light. Goodnight warm months. Come again soon, as you leave for many moons. As I rest forever in bed.

For me I seek the morrow eve, yet I wait on my couch waiting waiting for my slumber. In the hybrid sprawl of sprawling suburban lights, holographic advertisements. Distractions from the snow, distractions from a world always night. I want to melt away from this world of mine. In the world of city lights, I seek the quietness of my mind. Unwind, rewind. Watch as my own reality distorts, and I reflect on past and future. Or even the Past Future, or the Future's Past.

Avast like a sailor in the world of city seas, as I scratch and wilt from my fleas in my hair. Starlight of my mind, conflicts with natural starlight. Fast food holographic covering the sky as artificial grains of sand. To cold a month for Birkenstock sandals barefoot, but one for clogs with socks, under wool lined jeans. Watch as I drown in a book of forty thieves. Or vape vapes vaping vapes. For my life is only now, not months ago. Watch as I wait the hours, before I must decide to go.

I've dreamed dreamed, I've dreamed night terrors. I've had parents and friends like holy terrors. But for now I am alone, and only have myself. I suppose you may want a dialogue story, yet why talk to yourself. Cliches limitless. I'm uncertain why I would want to ride a bike, I've never rode since I was merely a tike. I was merely a tike on a bike. Before you laugh, keep in mind I always hated heights. My mom kisses my broken knees, and gives good nights. Goodnight memories, fading light city lights. Goodnight everything in this world, as I say goodnight.

Every day I live like it's my last.

Avast across the seas of infinite misery, for my life has always been a test. Of what test, I know not. I may have once known, but since then I forgot. Oublier, I am Oubliette. And this is yet another day, my creeping crawling final story. I wait the hours, I completely let myself go. I wait the snowflakes fall, and I watch them merge in all the merged snow.

At times I wish I were in the past futures, futures of the yesteryear. Yet as I drink my final beer, I imagine that there was probably as reason said futures never come true. I've leave said reason to your imagination, while I indulge in my bed to my final indulging masturbation. Masturbation to severed things, while I read the pages of fourty thieves. I seek these final pages, or any book I can choose to concentrate. Not focus on the will to masturbate to princesses losing their heads, placed on stick.

In a world far beyond the fall of falling snowflakes. Every day I plot my own non existence, there are things that keep me going. Things outside of my control, for I exist in my own constant present. Not past futures, or speculations of what I will do, for what I will do is always shot down by those who wish to pin me down, and become like an unwanted button on their aging shirts since retired and tossed into the garbage dump.

I want to have things to hump. I like dark haired women, with a lovely rump. Yet for me my mind always goes to severed heads, and their lovely stumps. Some my speculate on desires of for self-destruction, but it has always been since my dreams of alien abduction. Impaled girls, impaled lives.

Come to the darkness... Where one dines on their wives. The darkness of my meadow of gold. The meadow of the false promised life. A life of non start. My non life."

She looked at other girls, and thought only of disdain. The evening weather was slightly cool, yet warm enough to play game of pool by the swimming pool. Yet she was not one pool playing. At least not in thin leather coats. Having one considered the game, once playing it with her old flame, she thought only of things when her mind took her back to the time, on that day years ago. The local homeless man was playing his harmonica, rolling around in his wheel chair. He reminded her of this one guy she knew up in Washington. The guy, at the local homeless shelter, really more like psychiatric hospital for the urban dislocated, who would consume nothing but drinkable yogurt by in his tint. Well they called it a tint, but really it was more like a tarp. Just something to keep him warm at night, and protected from the rain.

While she had been through a rough patch, she tried to remind herself that others had been through worse. Though not always of active thought, but by the things she did when walking to family dollar to buy some smokes. She had been there often enough she was getting discounts, and got help from men that looked like vampire counts with their caps on backwards. She would got a pack of smokes for $3.95, despite the 4,45 price tag. She always wouldn't get IDed, and would always get referred to as ma'am. A passive thought in her minds wondered whether this was a trap, and at some point whether she would take advantage of deals long enough to get a reputation. And through that eventually get busted for handing out smokes. Yet she knew she was prone to flights of paranoid fantasy on every starry night, as she loiters under the glow of the apartment light.

She drowned herself in bits and bytes of Ruby code, figuring out now excuses for encryption schemes. Arline had only recently gotten sound back on her computer, even if it took plugging in her head phones to do it. She thought only the time when she hung out with her last room mate, before she had gotten herself some implants. At time she had only just recently gotten into the idea of some day getting some implants to try on different levels of sensory perception. She had gone for a while without using her remote viewing scheme, recently getting back into the flow of the video game. In some ways she identified more with @ man than people in the real life, pretending to be vampire assassins in the world of ASCII. But she never ASCII the question whether she would eventually become addicted. She used to spend more time online than going out into the real world to study the flow of the non-code called life. At one point she had been locked out of her apartment, and was stressing out about how to get back inside. She had had a run in with the guy that asked her--hey you wanting you something--before locking himself back into her studio. Considering the fact that most people she had met here were relatively noise, something had a hard time getting used to, there had come to be something heraldig about the guy with black trench coat acting like an asshole that night. Even night under the glow of the L.E.D. light she thinks only of yesterday as if it would be yet another tomorrow. For her, it was almost as if there was not a future at all.

Her life before the fall.

Her life before the flow of tobacco tea. She thought at times of returning to using tobacco tea instead of previously rolled cigarettes, and yet she also dreaded its medicinal taste. Yet in a way she appreciated, it was the taste of life with all of its bitterness. She missed the feeling of being drunk. With wine she respected alcohol enough not to be to heavy with it. Yet with nicotine there was no such respect. There was no such halting the flow of bug repellent with her system. After all if bugs didn't like it, then why should a human. She thought how her insides were always filled with butterflies, and thought it appropriate to let the poisonous drink flow like bathroom cleaner down the hatch. She thought of her mother, how she always mocked her for how little she took showed. Yet her mother didn't know that she was always tired.

She was fatigued and mired.

She was mired with the fall.

### Vincent Sharing Blood

Chattanooga was like a town that played as a city; it was governed like one, and yet its size limited its tourism to merely the value of historical interest.

Several new apartments were being built, and most of the restaurants were going out of business, with fewer and fewer replacing them by the year. In one, was a young hacker named Vincent, with his right arm converted into a synthetic flesh prosthetic. He opened the text based web browser using his holographic hand tattoo that used to be charged an arm and a leg for it, working seventy eight hour shifts at fifteen an hour before one could even hope to get one. But ever since he gave blood to the local clinical vampire, he now gets routine payments from the clinic tanks. His sister had worked in the red light district, being sold for two hour shifts to occasional werewolf packs.

During the day, he rests under the glow of the sun. But by night he conducts various forms of intelligence gathering, various statistics about how the fare-folk differentiate from standard sentience. He was a lapsed Catholic, now a nightly specter of his once self. He had hoped that there was a god that could save his sister from the worst of sexual abuses, but instead he had come to depend on a certain level of self-reliance. But his sister insisted on her line of work, saying it was the only way to keep them fed.

His own line of work only covered half a down payment for a warp mobile, the rest going to his various interest in different kinds of Linux laptops. They say if you hire a vampire, then the amount of work you get out of them for programming jobs outweighed the overtime pay an employer was required to pay out. One hundred years ago, people worried that it be Mexicans, but even they hated the current blood suckers. What remained of the United States was one of the few parts of the world that hadn't installed some form of Universal Basic Income. Move over to the California Republic, and you got those benefits, so he heard, but it was difficult to get in. And various fleeing vampire clans, ever since the proletarian werewolves decapitated the vamp queen, there was a level of fear that variety of the undead experienced that was far more intense than for a human being gently bit in the neck. At least for the girls in bow, and ballroom dancers, under the glow of Dark Wave lights, they savored the feeling of short gentle shivers down their spine. And they tingled from the flow of blood letting.

So most of the time one was grateful to live in Chattanooga, that had gradually turned into a specific variety of religious right. This made it especially dangerous for hookers, as they couldn't tell their friends, who were not in that line of work, that they were being assaulted by CyVamp cops. Vincent felt a certain degree of protectiveness he felt for nobody else by his dear sister. He had a sister in law, but she was kidnapped by dream-scanners, and now he barely recognized her, her mind and memories erased, complete with digital enhancements, like holographic tattoo, sonar, and various sensors one might more easily expect to see where a stealth bomber than a human being.

Bits and pieces of her personality would flow on IPFS, a collection of local host servers, connected through public gateways. And she would visit him while he would use Casefile, that allowed him to collect various forms of meta data without even having to break into an individuals computer. His sister and law tried to make him quit, but his addiction was simply to large. His girlfriend was decapitated by guillotine gun five years ago, and he had never been emotionally the same since. Part of him died when his sister died, the rest of him went when he gave his blood to a homeless girl in Market Street. He met at midnight, and she was barely clothed. He took off his jacket to keep her from freezing from the nuclear Winter snow. She fainted in his arms.

On his phone, he called an ambulance.

-- Emergency, there is a girl passed out besides me. I can't feel her pulse.

Little did he know, the girl was a vampire princess. She narrowly survived the onslaught of the governor's office. For his service, he now gets lifetime Universal Basic Income, while other rot in the street. He wished there was something he could do, but over time bits and pieces of mind scattered about, like chaffing and winnowing, filling the void with random images from the past, in particular, before the vampires evolved from humans. They had begun to form after World War III, and most people we call humans, are actually half human half vampire. They lack the sensitivity to sunlight like their old masters. He was one of the few pure humans left on Earth after the calamity from the sky. The others scattered about into various tribes in the Urban Forest.

On most days he chills out at the local dark wave scene, but tonight he wanted to go get some coffee at the local Irish pub, blended with scotch, vodka, and caramel, gently downed with Talon cigars, until the smoke would become to much for him to bare. For him, he contemplated the idea of running into a speeding car, but knew that there was a vampire darling child reliant on him. For, it made him feel like he could go on. When he arrived at the hospital, he gently held her hand.

-- How about a story?

-- Yes please.

-- It once started with a young bunny.

He kissed her on the forehead.

-- And what next.

A doctor came him, and told him that it was getting late. Vincent promised to complete the story sometimes soon. The girl waved goodbye and blew him a kiss.

Blown kisses reminded him of his first wife. The girl's eyes were also similar in color. There was something about her that didn't seem purely undead, as if her mother were a human, her father a CyVamp Dream-Scanner. She could know much about his past, yet only gently smiles at him, as if his own past no longer mattered, that there was only the future to look to.

He slept, he dreamed.

He woke up to a knock on the door.

It was one of those extended text message conversations from his sister. He knew that her line of work was dangerous, but never bother to say anything, as he always felt out of place in the conversation.

-- My night terrors have become more realistic, yet paradoxically unrealistic. Last night, it was about how I visited a Starbucks deeper into Chattanooga, right around where Sugars is (in real life there isn't a Starbucks there, as far as I know), and there I met these two guys that kept acting condescending of me being a woman into science fiction), and began sexually assaulting me in the store while the employees only watched and didn't act like they cared. The assaulter then messaged and blocked me on Diaspora for calling him out as being one who assaults women.

-- Yea people on decentralized social media can be losers sometimes. I've tried hanging out in some places, and it seemed like everyone I met was either paranoid schizophrenic, or anarchic-capitalist.

In many ways, Vincent and his sister felt worlds apart, yet in other ways they would more similar than twins. -- Did you know I'm giving blood Lucy?

-- No I didn't? Whose the lucky individual?

-- It's a young vampire girl. I'll need to go in and check on her later, I'm not entirely sure how the undead handles differences in blood type. You might think they'd check to see if the blood matches, but considering she's undead.

Lucy realized how it was that they had enough money to live away from their parents. Particularly her mother, had always told her that she would never have enough money to live downtown on her own. But suddenly loads of cash came in out of nowhere, as if from a mystical faucet. -- It seems like you care more about her than our own parents. Would you give blood to your own mother?

-- Irrelevant, mother has a different blood type.

-- And she's not a vampire.

-- Only for blood.

They say the media is filled with crooks, propaganda storybooks. The evening scrolls through various talking heads without knowledge of actual gun statistics, simply playing the mouth piece for their corporate masters. And in one scene, they mentioned how some places should ramp up surveillance in high schools, not even letting them in unless they pass through a metal scanner. Theater of security. Why even bring your kids to school, thought Vincent. It was far better to raise your own student. They wouldn't have to follow irrelevant school uniforms. American had trickle down economics, but the only thing immediate that actually trickled down was the age group to be spied on through Google OS laptops. The only solutions were those in order to devote them as a matter of a full time job, one needed to have already graduated high school.

When you're a blood donor to a half vampire, the only thing that bites is the feeling that she might never be truly tolerated in American society. The rest that bit had more to do with credit card vampires working for Wall street, in fact the only reason we're in this mess, is Wall Street. While most people blamed it on Walmart, the reality was Wall Start was many times richer than Sam Walton could have ever been, operating in Petro dollars on an international scale, invading various government across Europe, Asia, and South America. All this is on the record, though Microsoft bought MSNBC would like to tell you its all conspiracy. While subsequently marketing the Russian narrative, while Vincent contemplates voting for Jill Stein. At least she wasn't a blood sucker like Donald Trump. American already experienced its last stand after World War III, and somehow the Trump family managed to survive. But he only controlled a small portion of what was once the United States, with various states now Nation States, without their own spin on Libertarian philosophy. Nothing sucks blood like a decaying empire. And yet it's the vampires that American society hates, because it was the Vampires from South of the border, that simply wanted to live their life the best they could. Even if that meant evading medical care for fear of deportation to hell below the Bible belt. Vincent wanted to crush state authority like a school teacher giving a students paddle welts.

Vincent new friends in high school that wanted to join the Army, but now he assumed they had switched over to law enforcement S.W.A.T teams, tearing reality a new asshole, while the proletarian watch sessions of the super bowl. But for Vincent, he no longer thought of sports.

He thought only of thirst.

Vincent had mixed feelings about copywrite as a programmer of free software and as an observer of life. He wanted to own his own story, but share others coding efforts on IPFS.

IPFS was an interplanetary file system, similar to the internet. But unlike the corporate webs, each markup coder hosted their node on their own local machine, accessible by a public gateway. But Vincent missed meeting friends on places like Diaspora, flowing together like cybernetic dubstep dance floors.

He dreamed of meeting a French vampires, yet couldn't come to terms with wanting to decapitate them as much as loving them like blood unrelated siblings, while holding digital imprints of severed heads in his lap.

Vincent floated aimlessly.

He woke up from a nap.

The reality was if he tried dating real women, he couldnt sexually perform do to uncanny similarities. If a stranger looked like his cousin, albeit she was cute, it took to much mental work arounds for it not to feel like incest. Mixed with agoraphobia, he was lost in a sea of his own despair.

That day he got coffee, and was called ma'am again. ... Which he kind of liked.

Vincent was unsure of what to make of the machine reading. The computer suggested that the half vamp girl's heart was clinging onto life. Under the knife, she bleeds. She needs, she hungers. The doctors warn him that his supply may not be enough for her. But still he holds onto hope. He never ordinarily liked kids, ever since his siblings children came into the world. And yet now, here he was trying make one hold on just a little bit more. In his mind, he thought of children's stories he could read to her, and wanted to treat her to a camping trip roasting marsh mellows by the camp fire, even if the entire planet was essentially a burnt out camp ground by this point.

She gasps.

A month later, she becomes another cyborg vamp, trying to make it through. She visits Vincent occasionally at the hospital, giving blood to her giver.

It was time to give back.

Ladybug shared her blood.

Vincent and his three sisters shared a sibling from his father's second wife. Vince himself was the product of his third wife. He wondered what his forgotten sibling would look like, and how close she was to his father. He saw her in a postcard, decorated with Christmas decorations. Along side her dead brother, and Vincent's three siblings, she had dark brown hair. Ordinarily kids started out with lighter hair in their early years, and it would get gradually darker as they increase in decades. None of them seemed to look particularly happy in each other's presence. Almost like the Hatfield and McCoys. All those broken children's toys, and old books scattered about. Yet now instead of books was the third stage of the world wide web, the Interplanetary File System. You might think that with things floating around it, it would be easy to find loved ones. And yet, by the nature of gradually increasing data in different scales of infinity, this in fact made it difficult to find anyone.

He had been to a family get together with his cousins, and met a girl of similar age to he. It was one of his cousin's wedding, and she was one of her friends. The girl seemed aloof to everyone else in the dining hall, focusing primarily on her outdated Android phone. The only time she looked up, was when she spoke few word to Vincent. It was one of the few times her could find anyone that he could relate to, giving his social awkwardness. And yet do this very aspect of his character, he couldn't find it in himself to talk to her. So now he things of the lost opportunities, as he rots in his bed.

Vincent wanted to become a spy, but didn't want to work for the government. He wanted to have an assistant that can look inside areas of which he couldn't fit. With his friend he had given blood to, and her giving some blood back, they owed each other a certain level of sibling bond with benefits, as the girl become older. In a way, this was part of why he was attached to her. The other was that, in a way, she looked like the daughter of the girl he had met at his cousin's wedding all those years ago. And now, as she slips on her goggles to open the frame of an older laptop, she took instructions from her boyfriend, asking when operating system to load. Both carried a one time pad sub system to communicate when she was off to her Freshman year in college, coupled with a method of asymmetric authentication. They switched the keys and key pairs constantly. He constantly worried about her, although she insisted she could take care of herself.

He named her Ladybug. Ladybug carried ninja throwing stars, and at one point had to bite a man in the neck to get him off on her. She was the type of girl some would consider her attractive of Lolicon porn videos, despite being almost twenty. Her blond ponytail acting like a saddle for a pony. But she was always to fend off most guys, not so much by her strength, but by her wit.

She treated most guys like pieces of shit.

But she loved for Vincent, her doing the splits.

If Vincent could describe his life story, it would be a deadbeat musackle--a musical without lyrics composed of out of tune dial tones. He social life was tone deaf to any apparent vision of outsiders; but just because something is conventional wisdom doesn't make it smart. This upstart found that one could be smart, and still lack common sense. But sometimes being the uncommon sort meant doing things in an unconventional way. And in the world of computers, sometimes that was how hackers were born. He didn't start like most hackers, being an apparent early prodigy, much like his girlfriend. It was one of the things they shared, among other things. But she liked regular musicals, while he preferred the flow of music unaccompanied by country lyrics. His life seemed to flow away from him like a waterfall, his room mate the only life raft keeping him holding on. She reminded him of one of his school mates girlfriend's, and on some level it seemed there was a family resemblance. However this girl wore Boston Birkenstock clogs without socks more often than Emma ever did, whom only wore that style once. The shoes became somewhat of an association with sex with nerds for him.

But he had the maturity at this point, not to ask girls out for dates. He waited for them to make the first move, and let them invite him inside. This only became more exaggerated after he had become a creature of the night. The blood transfusion she gave him made him have a different level of abilities than he already had, although he remained the sort to hide from behind the scenes. He found he could turn into a bat, and crawl through holes like a rat. Or be a black cat lying down on its belly fat, to catch other midnight splats like mirror shade brats. He hung out in the shadows even more now, although it was already a note able habit. He had grown up wanting to become a werewolf, and at times he indeed Lucid Dream Shifted. But now with Vampire Blood flowing in his veins, this added certain methodologies that was unconventional for canids, although it wasn't anything like you would expect from the Underworld movies, for if one had both abilities sometimes they would become a master of none.

He kept programmer, despite his ability to run.

He wished to outrun vampire girls.

Except Ladybug.

When you stare long enough at a drinking glass and a rolling chair, sometimes your eyes begin to cross and it looks like the chair is blending into the glass. Vincent stared into his rolling chair, noticing Lady bug blending into his lap while she sucked his dick. The flow of friction blending with lubrication, the heat of the sun suddenly chilled with the coolness of Eggnog Ice cream.

The life.

It always seemed to be the football player/United States soldier type European exchange students seemed to go for. Whether that be German links, Belgian Waffles, or French toast. Vincent came to consider French in particular to be slimy frogs, only a little bit better than his fellow American kin. No matter where he lived, he always felt like an outsider. His friend Liana in particular he always felt confused, as she seemed to like toying with him, but at the end of the day, like other girls in Blackman High School, it seemed like almost every straight girl went for the masculine mainstream type. At least nobody who was anarcho-communist, although at the time Vincent did not know of that term in particular. But vaguely remembered when his mother told him about the political compass test on line.

And the strange thing was, if he were to ask her about it today, she would deny having ever heard of it, that it was him that introduced the concept. He didn't trust any woman, like his mother, but especially foreign girls. Not because of any particular disdain, but simply from getting tired of all the years he'd been rejected by attracted woman, at least in his head. Although he was never brave enough to directly ask anyone out. And the last exchange student he knew, only knew him by his most embarrassing mistake. In retrospect, her giving him German Marks (right when the EU was switching to the Euro, or Gyro as he would joke) may have been a clue she either liked him, or wanted to pay him off in order to keep his wanting glances away.

And now he wasn't sure how to feel.

But Ladybug didn't seem to notice his feels.

He rarely went out much, given lack of work. He had worked for Goodwill Corporation, but had quit when his mom wanted him to work for his aunt in Knoxville, Tennessee. Later on his cousin would move in, and eventually Vincent would move out into an extended stay hotel. But now in his studio apartment, one might think, if not for the rent payments every month, that there was nobody there inside for a considerable amount of time. All that changed somewhat when Ladybug came into the picture, but that still left enough time on his own to look at different kinds of animated porn on different fetish sites. Although these days this has become few fewer, since he had switched to IPFS. Now it took just as much time building up one's web page, but it came with the territory, as his favorite JRPG character would say.

He had never been a huge fan of Steampunk, considering it somewhat of a bastard child of Cyberpunk. But Grandia was one of the unique exceptions to this rule. Although in retrospect, this was probably an ill advised opinion, when he started opening to read one of the first Steampunk novels. For a considerable amount of time, he had written primarily science fiction, but now generally wrote a variety of scifi styled magical realism. Some elements of society and technology simply need no explanation, although some elements may be different from what one may expect. In this way, he was similar to the author of this story. However he was male, and I am female. But it seemed like every character I write would end up similar to me, whether I liked it or not. For Vincent, it was simply his own desire to fulfill dreams that I could only imagine.

Yet the melting clocks of time, gave way to humming midnight fairies, and Vampires drifting from the world of waking and sleeping. Vincent wanted to be part of his own story he wrote for himself.

It was like a collection of blank pages.

It was time to leave a note.

Vincent wasn't used to the social life. Having been raised in a small town, in the same state he always been since he was a child of the early twenty first century. So when ladies flirt with him now, it was a mix of feeling flattered, and feeling like it was to little to late. He had never been much of a flirt. Even Ladybug, whom he had raised into her college years, considers him more of a father than someone to fuck around with, although even she can't resist sucking his dick after classes. Most of the classes were audited, and the few homework she did have was mostly done during her off hours at campus. On some level, he didn't want to spend his life dating, as while it was never an issue with him, he would always worry whether girls would cheat on him, and yet strangly, not be open to the idea of polysexual relationship. He was under the impression that girls preferred football player and American soldier types, rather than Anarchists. And he was among the most leftist of the collectivist anarcho culture.

His best friend was more on the right leaning spectrum, although its been months since he had seen them. She was the one that got him into joining The Satanic Temple, who have now achieved a certain level of political ubiquity in government offices as a viable third party. Vincent was unsure whether the TST temple was really all that picky about who joined their club, although they certainly pretended to have things like background checks. Back if someone like Demi or Lilith could join, perhaps TST wasn't anymore Left Libertarian than Church Of Satan. Vincent had always been one of a kind, or even more now that he combined elements of Cipherpunk philosophy, civil war re-constructionist, and Anarcho-Communism political vies. He never found a group he could completely click with.

For Ladybug, she was his assistant.

But he still collected most meta data himself.

-- On November, Xor the scans. Your papers have arrived. Tonight lets dine out. Xor keys to use, bathe later After midnight. Wednesday afternoon.

Vincent rolled up the message, and burned it in his cigarette. He was unsure what his sister was wanting, except he knew that he hadn't seen her in a while. Perhaps she merely wanted to say hello, but she wasn't sure. Vincent knew there was a lot of means of secure communications that simply had no equivalent in the world of computers. Whenever her wanted to send keys to a corrospondent, he would first encrypt them using his sister's public key. In order to mislead any potential interceptors, he would have several different versions of red herring private keys presumed to be his sister's private keys blended in together in a deck of cards. He would shuffle these cards several times, and package them with the message. This way, while his sister still had her real public kept in her posession. In this way, the secret police would assume they already have the private keys, and would focus on trying to decrypt the session key.

Both he and his sister only used a session key once, although there was a time in the distant past when they used one twice. But no more than two times, as any private agent worth their salt, knows if two messages can be encrypted using the same key, then all other messages back into the end of time could stil be decrypted. In real life, they focused on using stream ciphers rather encrypting bulk data with block ciphers.

At the diner, his sister told him what the message was really about. She had made arrangement with the local front restaurant, that in order to conceal their tracks, served real food and alcohol. In the back, she told him about a secret organization called World Oasis, an espionage ring that has recently been apprehended. But several members wanted new talent to refill their ranks. It was composed of a mixture of humans and vampires, who wanted to hide their subversive activities under the form of legitamate activities like book stores, so they can more aptly hide than their Antifa counterparts. The only reason they were captured at all, was because of a rogue CIA agent, working for both the Central Intellegence Agency and World Oasis. They needed talent to weed out double agents, using current state of the art civilian information gathering.

Vincent was unsure of what to make of the proposal, as he had never had to have a job since after high school, and even then his mother wanted him to work for his aunt instead.

But some things have to give.

-- We'll see.

The nature of the internet is a mixture of truth and disinformation; Jennifer Laurence could star as the wife of shipwrecked Christopher Columbus in American, and her mother beheaded by axe and block for giving them wrong direction, the ship crashing into a jungle, and being burried by a giant Tsunami. Instead, the internet might say that it was Jennifer Laurence that had her head chopped off living at the MCs aunts in a slumber party where Vincent would use the bathroom, sleep, masturbate, and eat dinner inside the living room, finishing up by saying he fixed their loose cabinet, but they still might want to see a professional later. And its Jennifer Laurence's family that shipwrecked in the Americas, their ship buried under an ice burg on the coast. Vincent remembered her a teacher he knew once said perhaps someday we would no longer have ice burgs. He proposed covering it with wax while it still existed, and plant that in the middle of the ocean. In this way, plastic lasts forever unlike Ice. And who gave a damn about the fishes consuming its toxins under the sea.

And yet on the other hand, he was sick and tired of politicians catering to social justice topics, rather on the overall poverty of all Americans. It was only in America where even Black politicians would ignore the votes of their African American constituents, with the oddity of black people calling their black president racist again them, and claiming that white people could not be poor. But reality was more complex. In the US, everybody who wasn't a movie star was barely able to qualify for food stamps, and yet still politicians talks exclusively about the plight of people of color, as if they somehow knew, their time was almost up, and they needed to hold off the most important conversation: that it was more important to talk about the poverty of all Americans.

And not just pretend care.

We needed healthcare for all.

Vincent wanted to minimize the amount of junk on his computer, and encouraged Ladybug to do the same. At times he would collect as many as thirty different home brewed encryption programs, but realized that he could improve on the two main public key infrastructures: RSA (that requires two large primes for its trap door function), and Diffie Hellman (that relies on difficult logarithm problems); he needed a system to allow him to send an actual message rather than just a session key, so it needed to be short enough not to be vulnerable to Known Plaintext attacks. Ladybug kept a log of different character profile details of different mob bosses and corrupt corporate CEOs on her laptop, but was not yet much of a coder.

Vincent didn't want to contend with Mob Bosses directly; like other cults there was a risk that if one murdered them, it would martyr them into something like a saint in the eyes of those who follow them. With their death, he couldn't continue to scan for information about them. Instead he wanted them to be die alone, forgotten, and their followers scattered about like the wind. In the case of the leader's murder, like Joseph Smith, the very nature of their death creates a grouping that had continued to last into the twenty first century. The future wasn't paved with roads of air and flying cars, but cyberspace cults; INTERNET mafia lords in corporate castles.

Our current life was not one big brother, but different varieties of little brothers with different partitioned job titles, none of which new anything about the other professions, For the mob, their profession was death. However, World Oasis was not like the mafia of the roaring twenties, whatever the truth of the actual poverty rate. Instead they were closer to what one point label contractual spies, rather than government hired hands. There were government restrictions on how people's data could be used in the government, but there was no law as of yet against conducting such surveillance as part of trade secrets. World Oasis had a psychic espionage ring, composed primarily of remote viewers, but also people to maintain the computer's of the front company: a company that sold divining instruments and magic books, in a world where people have long sense given up on magic. Even Latin Americans began to feel as if the Universe had lost its mystery.

And yet, at the same time, the modern world had its own variety of mysteries, clocked in the darkest reaches of government conspiracy, even eventually corporate conspiracy. Vincent didn't want to be a product.

Ladybug had a stealth prosthetic eye. Rather than glass, it was made from biologically inert synthetic flesh, microdot cameras embedded within.

She had this ever since the World Oasis removed her left eye as a punishment for screwing up. But she was able to heal quickly, being part vampire. But she remained low key up until the point that she had met Vincent. She was taught various techniques of information gathering, including picking away at passwords using dictionary attacks, periodically changing her digital fingerprint and mac address. Her father, a full blood, had been adapt at safe cracking, but this was the software age, and the way locks were constructed were completely different. It only took one photograph to collect them inside a database, with both hidden and overt identities . Even with a one time concealment device, it was difficult to find good spots to hide local servers and QR codes. It had been a few months since she had graduated college. She had wanted to get a Masters Of Fine Arts, but settled for a Bachelors.

hile Vincent himself never bothered with college, claiming that it was all a scam, she held onto the idea of being qualified for an English teacher position. But she was not allowed to work, having previously worked for a non national spy gang. Even if she swore off the brain drugs, there was also a portion of this still flowing through her veins. With humans, it was simply a matter of having the right dose of nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine. But for those with vampire blood flowing within, they needed medication to treat their sensitive skin. If you were lucky, one of the one percent, you could get by even without health insurance. But the rest of the creatures of the night had to make do with various arcane street concoctions, things you never knew whether they really had Swamper or Krocodile. Swamper was a linguistic distortion from the word Vampoma, a play on words that combined vampirism with glacoma. For the blood suckers desires, they craved an end to their misery.

They wanted Swamper like weed.

You might think, if you lived in Chattanooga for about a year, you'd get used to its specifics. But some things you never quite can. For one thing, it was the kind of place where, despite being two thousand and eighteen, there were still people walking around in hippie clogs and acid trip woven shirts made of nylon. And yet despite the veneer of the counter culture, politically it was closer to authoritarian conservative more than any of city that Ladybug had ever been. She herself never dressed like a hippie, except for her Birkenstock Boston clogs. For everything else she wore, there was mainly black polyester: the short shorts she wore, the short sleeve t shirt, and her ankle socks. She wore a pair of Ballistics goggles, something for which Vincent wondered why considering the both of them only ever went out at night.

But they both knew that at night street cameras were most active, with specific details of surveillance more subtle in the current decade than the clunky electronics of the past. And now espionage was taught in grade school, the intelligence services were more careful about how they approached collecting intelligence. At times they would even bargain with those who find out they were being watched, but agreeing to not turn them in: if the victim were an adult, sexual favors were exchanged., fellatio being the most popular sort. But for those still in high school, usually they'd purchase them tickets to their favorite R rated movie, couple with government grade false IDs. The agents would cover their backs. However neither Vincent or Ladybug had such contacts in high places, and thus had to have the utmost care in covering their tracks. So when World Oasis came a calling, Ladybug was unsure what to expect.

She knew better than to trust them at their word.

In the book nineteen eighty, O'Brien was the type of guy to set up false flags about the brotherhood. It made Ladybug especially caution about trusting anything on the surface level, and therefore only agreed to meet people in undisclosed locations, usually with their faces covered by Guy Fawks masks. Even still, the conversation were mostly superficially docile, subtly eluding to threats of her own livelihood if she were to disclose their trade secrets to Vincent. But one night, she proposed the idea of having him help them finding information about the local authoritarian democrat candidate, so that they could have something they could use against the candidates in such a way, as to give them the edge of corporations that would want to bribe them to enact certain local policies.

-- I'll think about it. The case officer said.

-- Thanks.

Ladybug left Vincent a message, but she was unsure whether he would receive it. She carefully embedded it in Vincent's steganographic code.

She went out the door, and went on her way to try to have a conversation with her case officer, about negotiating a deal on how to best go about hiring. Vincent was not yet a vampire, and he only briefly dabbled in remote viewing. But she hoped that perhaps eventually she could get him back into, despite the skepticism of people that he had met on the web. After all, skeptics often did not have an accurate picture of reality, often being the same kind of people that vote for political office in a reactionary fashion. But Vincent was different, he thought carefully through his decisions. Surely he must have known the societal impact of his decision to give blood to vampire, and yet for whatever reason he chose to give his life fluid anyway when in any other circumstance of his life, he was shy like a mouse in bed. But he would watch girls with knives in their necks, yet would go out of trance.

But when he chose to focus, on things that he was interested in, he would most definitely complete the task that he would assign for himself. Her case officer wanted the phone number of the most current Green Party Candidate, but was to careful to outright do a web search for them himself. He had plenty of servants through the last two decades, that would do his bidding in the most closely kept secrecy of his corporate chambers. For Vincent, the one whom Ladybug wanted to bargain with, his only chamber was his bedroom, under the idea that staying inside at all the hours of the day would protect him from government surveillance. But there was more than one way to skin a cat.

And Vincent was a wild cat.

She stalked for her bargain at night.

Vincent the Psychic.

Ladybug had always been short, although she had tried wearing high heels to accommodate this fact, but now she exclusively wore Birkenstocks inside, and hiking boots during urban exploration at night. Vincent was unaware of the fact that she had got herself a pet rat, back when she was exploring the sewer system. The other vampire agency, one that World Oasis had always fought against, captured her one night. Bound by a rope from a street light pole, she clung onto it to try to force it off. She had inadvertently brought the vermin, though she never thought of her as such, from the sewer entrance, when she carried for herself a slice of Bacon and Mushroom pizza. She felt a rumbling, and a gnawing in her purse, and gently rummaged her her hand through it. The rat hopped into her hand, because it was unable to get out, after having some of her pizza. She gently brushed the rat's back, it giving her puppy eyes. She asked what it was doing in there.

The rat pecked her cheek with its tongue, and a friendship was formed. She would bring the rat with her when she went to college, carefully hiding it in her backpack, and giving the contraption holes for it to breath in. She had gotten to the point in her technical expertise, that her sole rivals in computer security class never bothered to help, and thus never looked through her things without her consent. But one night, she had left her second backpack outside the door, and it being Chattanooga, the backpack was stolen. For months she thought the rat was lost, but instead it was able to gnaw itself out.

Tonight, she felt a similar gnawing in her purse.

The rat had returned to see her. She was unsure how Vincent would feel about her old best friend, but knew that he also had unconventional interests as well. She just hoped that he didn't hate rats.

Vincent remembered the time before he moved back to Chattanooga.

The sky above the memory lane was covered in acid rain. "The first porn pills that I would ever take." he said, hoping for a final goodnight.

Bits and bytes, it was the stuff taught as basics in high school computer class. Boring, but necessary. At least at first. The flickered out at light speed,and I get on my computer. I checked logged in, checked email, and jacked out. He had tried various writing websites since the start of my class, and yet there was nothing like writing in my notebook at home. To think that, so young, he refused to roam with other cattle. Other girls, while more beautiful than he, were as close as you could get to cows. And so few among them, were as tender as the lambs. And, alone in the darkness, he savored their silence as he fell into a dream.

He thought of girls getting their heads taken off by guillotine, imagining brief acquaintances he knew at school dining in the blood of friends. He became puffed on, and he felt a coolness like someone washing his under regions with a wash cloth. And he dreamed of them speaking the King's French while whispering in his ear. Indeed, the rest of his school days would be an excellent year. You wouldn't think someone as harmless looking, would have a thing for blood, and yet the more his sexuality developed, the more certain desires had intensified since graduation. He despised crowded events, like graduation and wedding day. He preferred to ride horses in the clouds, seeing shadows split by illuminated lights of the streets. He stalked the night.

The night consents, as he wander in its shadows.

In its shadows, He carried a cane with him, feel something following him. Then he woke up, as if from a fall.

At times writing of his life is difficult, but that is because so often it has been far to strange for people to believe. His only wish was for it to be as normal as other vampires who stalk the night. When you see nothing but emptiness, at times your mind fills in the blanks. And often such thoughts come alive. And yet for the longest time, he had dreams of being taken aboard by alien spacecraft. He remember when he was young, a young grey told him that he wouldn't be harmed.

Many of his sensations of sex, have been with the grays from the reticulan region. Demons, angels, shadows; all these things are far more tame, his terrors far darker than the opus of Mein Kamph. For, as you see, he had gotten away with much, and yet do to the nature of it, almost nobody ever notices it. It was midnight, when he had met his sister in the red light district. She was wearing a red dress, and offered to take him in. He had moved out after his parents had died, leaving him behind at twenty eight. Now he goes through life wandering if there is any childhood left to live.

In his mind, he dreams of fantasy adventures of children flying gliders, riding on the wings on birds in flight. And yet he goes through his days plying his trade in stream and block ciphers, under the glow of black candle lights.

He never chose to publish the few novels he wrote, part of it being a matter of self-doubt, and part of it was the shame of his own sexuality.

It had been many months since World War III, and in many ways it both exceeded and and underwhelmed his imagination. Then robot rebels came and went, then the super computer overlords. On the run from dream-scanners, he found himself hoping for some kind of release from his misery. It started out as technology designed to scan your brainwaves testing for issues related to sleep apnea, but gradually evolved to watch over developments of deviant personality traits. And now he sleeps in wait, wondering whether they will come for him again at night.

Vincent considered himself more of a diarist, though he could see the confusion with science fiction. But his life was not a fiction book. At one point had wanted children, but it's to late now. We're children beneath the darkened sky. Beneath a shadowed sun. His body was meat.

He once knew a guy who would meet trolls under a bridge, although in actuality they were just homeless people trying to find a place to live. Even so, he would thrust them with one of his daggers, and watch as they reel in extreme pain. Needless to say, he wasn't friends with him for very long. Only for about a year. When he had left his sister's house, exchanging phone numbers, he kept her as a network contact while she was off the wire. He would explore bridges in the suburbs outside of the city, finding colonies of soldiers that had survived the war, making their life Terra forming the total darkness that was the underground sewers.

Cardboard cut outs were re-purposed into makeshift houses, where they stored cookware. Some of them had become bandits, because society didn't want them. He met two that were roasting rats on a stick, while he thought only of his sister. What we think of as sewers today, where actually ancient battle grounds built by a culture far older than Ancient Sumeria, possibly as much as 18,000 years in the past. And now, in the year 2019, we live in the aftermath of the great re-purposing back in the 1970s. But certain figures on the walls and statues give clues to this far ancient culture, who rode on flying wings that reached the sky. And now, here we are, eating roasted rats underneath the holographic metropolis, wondering when the bridges far above us will eventually fall and kill us.

-- I wouldn't give them one a year, said one bandit. -- What makes you say that man? -- See those columns above? They're already cracking. -- He pointed to the seemingly seamless column, implying that that was the one that would eventually collapse. It was an unstable life, not much better than the tail end of the nineteenth century, although they probably thought this was better than when they were rebuilt by their masters over in North Korea all those years ago. -- It's inevitable.

Indeed, the only reason they're still alive now, is do to a kind of genetic modification, that allowed their body to regenerate from radiation poisoning.But throwing up all the time do to their immune system made this aspect a miserable existence. He adjusted my mirror goggles, and then crash on his futon.

Nothing like sleep.

When Orwell wrote 1984, he wasn't expecting there to be simulation coastal vistas, using meat space avatars, while glancing the view while on the wire. Unlike like groups specialized towards sex education, in practice actual sex education was surprisingly prescient for the writer. And yet the thing that hit the eighties and nineties was virtual reality, then the world wide web. But now we're already having the idea of quantum networks being discussed, extending concepts of mass surveillance beyond what was conceived of in the nineteen forties. And the old public key systems were slowly going the way of the dinosaur.

The classic game consoles have become the latest dinosaurs, with each latest generation having their maximum development expectancy set around five years at the most, aside from the few home brew developers. I had given up game development a long time ago, prefering the flow of text on the page. And yet sometimes I miss the old days of loading the makers, and churning out demos of games in my development bucket list. But now, his own bucket list is to exist. And his thoughts display on quantum holographic networks displaying the words "to be or not to me, that is the question."

His drifting in the world of darkness, as if he was already dead.

He thought I heard a voice, in what seemed like a digitized version of an ancient language far older than the age of Egypt and Sumeria. The group of underground nomads had been walking through the tunnels for some time, when they found a previously undiscovered room. The others thought of it as a get rich quick scheme, finding spare parts to sell on the black market. Yet for me, I was preoccupied by the statue that stood before us by the flat screen computer monitors. It had a vague semblance of Roman and Egyptian statues, except that the garb looked to him from a previously unknown star faring civilization, indicated by the appearance what seemed to be some ancient space helmet.

The computer rooms were built on top of ancient Native American temple, from a culture that was as old, if not older, than the Inca.

-- Get a load of this lady.

-- Ain't she a beauty?

-- I wonder how much this stature would be worth? And look, not a single crack on it. While the others were thinking of how much they could sell it for, there was something about that gave off a sinister presence.

Vincent split from the others into a separate room. Just in time, as when one of them tried to steal the monitors, a false door opened up a portal that unleashed men with space helmets attacking them with laser beams. His friends told him to break for it, so he took his futon and left the scene trusting their judgment, and his instincts to survive. Suddenly the room grew quieter, and slowly quieter. It then became silent. One of the men came out alive, but said that they were all surrounded by armed guards from a different galaxy, and that they let him live long enough to reveal to me a message.

-- Don't go to far down here, there are things which we were not meant to see.

You might think that he almost died, but as best as Vincent could, he nursed his friend back to health. However his right arm continued to be bruised for the next few days after. He called his sister.

-- Can you do me and a friend a favor?

-- What do you need?

-- Medical attention.

It was the following morning me and my friend woke up in the hospital. He spent the entire morning watching television mindlessly, while trying to think of what happened in those tunnels in the darkness. He was left craving going back down to find out what the meaning of the symbols were, and the meaning of that statue. Since he wasn't injured, he left my friend to the care of his sister as he made his way back toward the tunnels, leaving my futon at the hospital. She said she would roll it up, and his friend could sleep at her place tonight.

As much as you get used to wandering the darkness, there isn't anything like wandering it alone. Vincent walked through the tunnels, slashing and thrusting giant rodents, and eventually came upon the room in which we had left. Already, the room had been cleaned up, despite having no natural reason for the corpses absence. He stared at the portal in which the monstrosities had exited.

He touched my hands along the wall

He found the room began to swirl around, and he warped into what seemed like a laboratory in hell, with various abominations, craving to eat his flesh. Vincent made sure to only stay inside of the lab. He heard a voice in the darkness. It was a young woman in her early twenties, who said that he should not have arrived there, that it was a top secret government facility.

Moments later she asked how he had found the place. Vincent noted that him and his friends had been living in the tunnels for some time, and that it was only recently that a friend of his had been kind enough to let them stay with her. But the lady, other than this question, remained largely elusive about what was beyond the tunnels.

He was knocked out by cyborg guards, woke up at Ravina's place.

-- And just where have you been? She asks.

-- Where am I?

-- At my place, you will always sleep here. -- She adjusted the blankets for me, while I situated on the futon.

-- I found you outside in the cold at midnight. Don't leave me like that again, and your friend, he needs you.

I had nothing else to say then. I was left thinking of the tunnels.

It was a year later he met Ladybug.

A new search engine: it replaced its logo with GNU Search Engine to replace the old Google, animated its background above the Earth's atmosphere; type in a search, and it takes you to a real time street view of everywhere on the globe.

It's primary function to connect to various street lamp and satellite images in real time. Even the hardiest of anarchists could not go into space, and knock out the power systems of the globalist elite. One could get specific time stamps of real life meta-data, from the color of people's houses, and the inside of people's kitchens. None of the spices that we use to cook with would be kept secret for very long, provided one lived in an Urban district, where people are constantly under surveillance from microphones and micro-cams hidden inside of the lenses. Even more overtly, you can't find a grocery store without some form of security camera. Most of the meta-data is collected by various micro-cams in public places, although new laws have been proposed to allow for spying inside of people's home. The most paranoid of outcasts, have had to adapt to living inside of RVs and portable tiny homes, in order to avoid the restrictions that come with renting a studio apartment. They say the footage is to prevent shop lifting, but the only thieves they ever apprehend are various minority groups.

Angela, who works as a museum curator, had just turned fifty five. For a vampiress, that would make her around fifteen, perhaps twenty at the oldest. Unlike her father, she chose not to have other cybernetic prosthesis to extend her lifespan, so she ages like the standard undead. In the public life, she displays to people various mock up severed heads of different vampire types produced after the third world war. At night, she goes around hunting other vampires, kidnapping women whom she charms with her youthful appearance, and then takes her to her home, where they are guillotined. The walls around her basement are sound proofed, and the only sound people outside will ever hear are faint sounds of whispers in the dark.

Angela has kept this double life for close to ten years. It helped that generally the non undead police division was reluctant to even admit to the existence of the undead. And the undead forces would rather let a murderer go free, than clue into the fact that vampires exist. It was a very unique time after the fall of the United States, when various states went onto to become their own independent nations, most notably in the South, that has a degree of bitterness about their plight since the end of the first Civil War. Within this environment, it wasn't until her girlfriend Dianette, whom she had grown up with since middle school, eventually discovered her basement one evening, and found out the truth of why Angela was able to find so may types of vampire heads, within this large basement, she met a conspirator that had connections to World Oasis, before splintering off, and aided Angela in making the humans she seduced look like they committed suicide.

It was simply a matter of making them bit onto the rope that held the blade up. All she had to do was paddle them, and eventually the pain with making them open their mouths. They carefully made sure there was not any hidden security cameras, and in this way, Angela had a steady supply of vampire heads, that she decorated with native American face paint, claiming that vampires had existed in the US long before the American empire. It helped that this was largely true, except that native Americans were never recorded as having been Francophone and blond.

One night, Danette sneaked behind Angela. She took out her blowgun, and aimed true. She aimed it into her pressure point. The blowguns were able to make less noise than AR-15s, meaning she could slink away at light speed, and make her girlfriend's death look like a suicide. The leader of World Oasis, Angela's father, wanted Ladybug and Vincent to locate the whereabouts of Danette, so they could squelch the threat to their family's livelihood.

Even if it meant cracking some eggs.

Suppose one lived in a duplex, one connected by a autocratic patriarch, the other ruled by Libertarian Social Democracy; on one side, the Left Libertarians run their household purely on green energy, and the flow gravity and water. The other side runs by standard fossil fuels. If the water flowed inside the house, the water could accidentally flood the house of the patriarch. The family of green as a group decided, they would dig a whole that leads the underground river, so that the water would not flow into the patriarch's side of the duplex. This was a family of group decisions, while the other was based on the decision of one. Culturally, this was to be expected; the patriarch came from the deepest of the Southern part of the United States. The ones that liked green energy had been lived for many years in the California Republic, only visiting Tennessee in order to visit with family.

The green family had one daughter, who slept on a hammock; she wore a green tee shirt, blue jeans, and a pair of green wooden clog slippers to bed. She would at times complain about how their living room smelled like fish. This was because there was a deep pit, surrounded by glass walls to keep the flowing water out, in the middle of the room. But for the most part, she benefited from the constant supply of electricity that she came to take for granted. Her neighbor, around her age, lived largely with the opposite situation. He would constantly lock his door to protect himself from his dictatorial father, and there would be constant power outages do to the overbearing government regulations on energy usage. This meant, at times, the patriarchs family having to rely on cold cereal for dinner, instead of pancakes and bacon.

The boy slept on the floor, largely because his parents could not afford a bed. But he had his own methods of communication under the nose of his parents. La Belle de l'Verte famille would sometimes talk to him by Styrofoam cups, connected by a line that reached a same cup on the other end. She spoke of how back in the North West, she had known a friend whose family had came from Indiana. When she would ride the air-rail bus with her friend, her friend noted how sometimes, it seemed like the bus would time a brief dip in the Indiana shopping mall district, an urban sprawl composed largely of millions of micro shopping malls; soon the entire state would be a giant shopping mall. For Belle, she would note how the scenery would melt into the visuals of this shopping mall.

Then when they finally reached the shop, suddenly the scenery would revert back to Los Angeles. And how they didn't quite have the same kind of technology here. The boy on the other end, would always be fascinated by such stories, and wondering why there indeed wasn't such technology here. Instead, he mainly kept a laptop, as a gift from his parents. Here, because of his parents restrictive demands against using the network, made from himself a sneaker network composed of groups of different thumb drives, exchanging messages at school. He didn't have worry about social steganography while on the wire, because the only social network was a homemade one, composed of the urban underground within Chattanooga.

His friends nicknamed him Sputnik, because of his love for Russian media, instead of the state run media. Exchanging thumb drives with his girlfriend neighbor would seem a little off to his overbearing parents, so he worked around the problem by telling her by cups, what the name of the video was on RT, and Belle would browse to this page on her home network that her parents did not restrict. In this respect, there was a certain level of unspoken equality between the two, despite the two family's large political differences.

Although Sputnik himself was just as green as Belle, although for sake of his own privileges, until he ran away from home, would not speak of his views, because he wondered whether his parents had eyes in the walls. Sputnik wanted to eventually move in with Belle, but she was unsure how her parents would feel, despite them being generally freer about sexuality; but they were more concerned about what would happen to Sputnik, and they certainly did not want harassment by Sputnik's father in chief. At night, Belle and Sputnik would exchange information about current news in the quietest corner of the cafeteria, and they would mask their words using null ciphers in order to conceal the information from the security guards that patrolled the area for those plotting any sort of disobedience. This was where the term Belle Ciphering came from.

And Vincent used them liberally.

As liberally as a green.
